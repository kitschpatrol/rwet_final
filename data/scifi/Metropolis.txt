84	91	Every epoch dreams its successor. - Jules Michelet
137	139	Presently, we...
139	142	...as a nation, are about to touch the heavens!
143	146	I am thrilled to have the honour of announcing...
147	151	...the culmination of mankind's history of scientific achievement!
153	155	Our power will shine across the world...
155	157	...across the universe!
158	162	May you be eternal! Our Ziggurat!
260	264	Robots are so insolent these days! It's just outrageous!
264	268	Our economic future is inconceivable without robots.
268	272	The problem is friction between robot and human labourers.
272	275	I heard that an enemy nation has a new weapon.
275	281	That is why Metropolis needs a stronger, more charismatic leader!
288	290	Congratulations! Congratulations!
296	300	Congratulations on the Ziggurat. Will you be going into politics?
300	302	What a thing to say!
302	306	If President Boon remains healthy and in office...
306	308	...our nation is secure.
308	310	There's nothing left for me to do.
311	314	Any requests for Duke Red to go into politics?
314	316	Don't egg him on like that.
316	320	I'm no match for Duke Red in popularity.
323	327	There are rumours that the Ziggurat is actually a military facility.
328	331	May we have a word from the mayor about this?
332	335	Address that to Skunk, the minister of state!
336	338	Hurray for Ziggurat!
339	341	Hurray for Metropolis!
344	348	Say, Uncle, what is the "Ziggurat"?
348	350	I'm not sure.
352	354	Hey, look at that!
354	355	What is that?
362	365	Marduk. The sign of the Marduk.
377	378	Damn!
380	381	Hey! He's over there!
416	420	Oh, I see, I see...
439	442	It's supposed to be ready tonight, Dr. Laughton!
442	443	Well...
444	447	I provided you with money and top facilities...
447	450	...just as you asked! You've failed me!
450	454	Please allow a little more time. I'm almost finished.
455	457	I'm tired of the same old excuse!
458	459	I'll see it tomorrow night.
460	464	But it's not a place worth your trouble to visit.
464	466	And besides, it's a mess.
466	469	I'll see you tomorrow night!
483	484	It's Rock.
484	487	There was commotion in the plaza.
488	490	Yes, a robot was out of his zone.
491	494	No excuses. You're in charge of security.
494	495	Yes, Father.
496	500	You idiot! I am not your father!
500	504	I took you in, you were an orphan from the last war!
504	506	- You assume too much! - Yes, sir.
509	511	An accident has occurred in District 45!
511	514	All cars, please rush to the site immediately!
514	517	Car 3 here.
517	521	Pursuing a robot believed to be outside his zone.
521	525	All cars in the airport area, take precautions and standby.
528	530	HQ, HQ! Car 8 here...
530	534	I am Shunsaku Ban, a private detective from Japan.
534	539	Where's Superintendent Notarlin? I have a letter from the police commissioner.
547	548	I see.
549	552	So this Dr. Laughton is...
552	554	...hiding here in Metropolis?
556	558	Is that what you're saying?
566	567	Exactly.
567	572	I heard from an organ smuggler who's had dealings with him.
572	576	And the international defender of human rights...
577	581	...has issued arrests for the use of live animals in experiments...
581	583	...and trafficking organs.
583	587	I would very much like your cooperation on this.
587	590	This is my first time here...
590	593	...and I have no idea which way is what.
595	597	Of course, I'd like to help you...
597	599	...but the celebration for the Ziggurat...
600	602	...will continue for another week.
602	605	It's very busy amidst all this hubbub...
605	608	...and we're short-handed as it is.
608	611	I have no one to help you on such a case.
611	615	I have no men, but if you'd be fine with a robot...?
615	616	A robot?!
618	621	Yes, a robot. It's a very excellent robot.
621	624	It has no authority to arrest humans...
625	629	...but it can investigate, so I think it'd be useful to you.
633	637	I don't have to return it with a full tank, do I?
639	642	No, it needs refuelling every five years.
648	651	Soon they won't need humans anymore.
652	654	I'm Kenichi. Nice to meet you.
655	661	I am Model 803-D, RP, DM, 497-3C.
663	667	- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
676	679	Soon, with the completion of the Ziggurat...
679	682	... we'll lead in industry and culture.
682	686	From this day forward...
687	690	... it can be said that this is the birth...
690	693	... of a 1000-year nation.
694	697	I'm thrilled to have the honour of announcing...
697	702	... the culmination of mankind's scientific achievement!
703	705	Our power will shine across the world...
705	707	... across the universe!
708	712	May you be eternal! Our Ziggurat!
718	724	Now, where should we begin? 803...
725	729	D, RP, DM, 497-3C.
730	732	Don't you have an easier name?
733	736	We are not given names like people.
736	739	Some fear it would infringe on human rights.
744	745	Oh, I know!
745	748	Starting now, your name is Pero! Pero!
748	751	That sounds like he's a dog.
751	754	Yeah, it's the name of a dog I had.
755	756	He was a fine dog!
757	761	In my opinion, I believe there is no place...
761	764	...for a criminal to hide in Metropolis.
764	768	What are you talking about? I heard he's here.
768	772	If Dr. Laughton is in hiding, he is unmistakably in Zone 1.
773	774	Zone 1?
774	778	- It's the underground world. - That's your detective's intuition?
778	783	Just a matter of probability calculated by my electronic brain.
806	809	We robots each have our own occupation.
809	812	Our activities are restricted accordingly.
812	814	That robot...
814	818	...was prohibited from any activity at surface level.
826	831	But who are those people dressed like fascists?
831	833	The Marduk Party.
834	836	They handle robots outside their zone.
836	840	Traffic between levels is limited according to rank.
841	846	People and robots not marked for certain zones may come and go.
846	849	- So that robot we saw was marked? - Correct.
849	851	There's a gate for every block, but...
852	855	...smugglers guide others through passageways...
855	857	...so incidents happen.
857	860	Such a system shouldn't exist anyway!
864	869	Well, well, I suppose light creates shadows.
869	873	This level is still not that dangerous...
873	875	...but depending on the location...
876	879	...there are areas without police, so be careful.
879	881	That's all right.
881	884	We didn't come here to be tourists.
896	898	Hurry up and come home!
898	900	Where in the world did that child go?!
901	904	I was outside for a while, so I wasn't at home.
905	906	Where'd you go?
907	909	I've come back with some stories.
942	944	Duke Red.
944	946	Let's see it, Laughton.
964	966	She looks perfect.
966	968	You're sure she's not finished?
969	974	Well, her fuel system is not stable, so...
975	978	Did you use organic machinery?
978	982	Not at all! I would never use illegal means!
982	987	Organic machinery is a quick fix, but it doesn't last long.
987	990	I've created her from mechanical parts.
990	994	She is the greatest work of my life!
999	1002	- When will she be complete? - Within the week.
1002	1004	If I activate her too soon...
1004	1008	...she could overload and might even blow up.
1012	1014	My little Tima.
1054	1057	I'm not going to hand you over to anyone.
1057	1059	I'll put the finishing touches on now...
1060	1064	...and you're gonna escape with me.
1080	1081	I know you. You're Rock!
1082	1083	How'd you find my lab?
1083	1087	Guarding Father is one of my many duties.
1087	1088	Father?
1089	1092	I don't believe Duke Red has any children.
1092	1094	Wasn't the child he lost a girl?
1095	1096	Shut up!
1096	1098	I know what you're up to.
1099	1103	You're trying to trick Father with your technology!
1105	1109	A mere puppet like this could never touch Father's heart.
1111	1112	What are you gonna do?
1112	1116	I am working on Tima at Duke Red's request!
1117	1120	He has plans for her. The last piece for the Ziggurat.
1120	1124	He will place her on the throne!
1124	1125	That's a lie!
1125	1129	Father would never have a mere robot rule the Ziggurat!
1130	1133	Then ask him yourself.
1134	1137	You'll shoot her? Knowing that "your" father...
1137	1139	...is waiting for his little angel?
1144	1148	I won't allow Father to be seduced by a robot!
1154	1157	No. Don't. Don't do it!
1165	1168	Oh, God, give me courage!
1169	1174	Give me the strength to guard my father from the evil machines!
1232	1234	A fire! There's a fire!
1235	1238	There's a fire! A fire! A fire!
1264	1266	A Marduk set the fire!
1267	1269	I saw him with my own eyes! I saw him!
1270	1273	Even the Marduks are trying to kill us!
1275	1277	Atlas is right!
1277	1280	They give us as much thought as they do trash!
1281	1284	Take up your weapons! Now is the time to fight!
1285	1287	Everyone, please calm down.
1287	1290	Work will soon extinguish the fire.
1291	1294	It's dangerous here! Please evacuate!
1294	1296	This is no place for a robot!
1298	1301	We lost our jobs because of you bastards!
1301	1305	- And now you're giving orders! - This is no time to be fighting!
1310	1312	What the...?!
1357	1360	Hey, Atlas, why'd the Marduks set fire to a factory?
1360	1364	An old guy was always coming and going from there.
1365	1367	Is this the guy?
1368	1371	- Yeah, that's him. - Thanks!
1381	1383	There's someone inside!
1385	1386	Oh, my goodness!
1386	1388	- You go around back. - Okay!
1388	1390	Hurry!
1446	1450	- Hang in there, Laughton! - My notebook.
1452	1454	You want that notebook?!
1455	1456	Laughton!
1494	1496	Laughton's laboratory burned down?!
1497	1498	It was an experiment.
1499	1501	The fire burned very quickly.
1501	1502	Everything was lost.
1502	1506	- What happened to Dr. Laughton? - They found his remains.
1508	1510	And not much else.
1511	1514	He was a criminal with many warrants...
1514	1517	...so perhaps it was a dangerous experiment?
1519	1523	What's wrong? Did you have business with Dr. Laughton?
1523	1524	Shut up! Leave me!
1525	1526	Let me be alone.
1626	1628	Where am I?
1639	1643	Man, that was a terrible fire!
1643	1646	Terrible? I don't care about a factory.
1646	1648	We got rid of something we didn't need.
1652	1656	Something's wrong. No matter how much the place burned...
1656	1660	... that robot was quality. Its skeleton should've remained.
1663	1665	Who is that man?
1665	1666	Rock of the Marduk Party.
1668	1671	He's young, but he's influential.
1671	1674	They say that Duke Red trusts him.
1674	1675	Duke Red?
1676	1679	How is Duke Red connected with the Marduk?
1679	1681	Duke Red is the founder of the Party.
1682	1684	They appear to be unrelated...
1684	1687	...but their funding comes from Duke Red.
1689	1694	It's a secret, but they do it so openly, everyone knows about it.
1699	1702	Where does this sewage go?
1703	1706	It dumps into Zone 2 up ahead...
1706	1709	...and goes to a disposal plant in Zone 3.
1709	1714	If they got that far, they won't be alive. They'd be treated as waste.
1715	1719	A normal human will always return to the site of the crime.
1720	1723	People had some good sayings back then.
1723	1727	Let us carefully look for Mr. Kenichi again.
1745	1747	Who in the world are you?
1748	1750	Who in the world are you?
1750	1754	No. Listen, you refer to yourself as "I."
1756	1758	Who am "l"?
1760	1761	"I am."
1761	1763	You are I.
1763	1765	No, listen.
1766	1770	You are "I." I am "you." Wait...
1772	1773	Who am I?
1774	1777	Right, right! And I'm Kenichi.
1778	1779	Kenichi.
1780	1781	Kenichi.
1783	1787	Well, just take your time remembering everything.
1787	1792	Your name, your home and your mother and father.
1792	1795	Home. Father.
1808	1813	Thanks. I know that's food, but it's already gone bad, so...
1814	1815	Food.
1815	1819	Yeah, you put it in your mouth like this and...
1819	1821	That's how you eat it...
1821	1826	Oh, no! If you eat that stuff, you'll get sick!
1826	1829	No? I can't eat? Sick.
1846	1847	Disengaging dome.
1847	1850	Time to radiation position: 40, 39, 38, 37...
1850	1854	The power system, cooling system, control system are all normal.
1887	1889	Final stage. Taking aim.
1890	1892	Magnetic aim, deviation error, 0.25.
1901	1904	Radiation mechanism, fixing final position.
1906	1908	Radiation time is three minutes.
1909	1913	It won't affect humans, but robots working on the surface...
1913	1915	...may malfunction.
1916	1918	We will record everything.
1919	1921	The data will be invaluable.
1922	1924	Start at Level 3.
1925	1927	Yes, sir.
1936	1938	Commencing irradiation.
1964	1967	3 seconds. 2 seconds. 1 second.
1969	1972	Omotenium fusion! Sunspot region expanding!
1972	1975	- Fraunhofer from the spectrum. - Positive 2 levels.
1976	1979	35,000. 40,000. 45,000...
1979	1982	Sunspot flare at point R, 49 observed.
1983	1986	Sunspot density at 800 and still rising.
1986	1990	There is a disturbance in Earth's ionization. No communication.
2004	2006	What are you doing?
2059	2061	Level 3 radiation complete.
2061	2064	Main control, discharging system.
2066	2068	It's a success!
2071	2074	The world will be in an uproar over this.
2074	2078	After all, you have the power of God in the palm of your hand.
2082	2087	If Dr. Laughton finished Tima, she now could have taken the throne.
2093	2096	It's a new weapon, sir. It creates sunspots...
2096	2099	...that bathes the Earth in radiation.
2100	2103	How dare they develop such a thing on their own?
2104	2106	It changes the balance of power!
2106	2109	Even with the Marduks hunting the robots...
2109	2112	...the rebels are screaming for human rights...
2112	2116	...instigating citizens by proclaiming change in Robot Laws.
2116	2120	Even civilian groups in favour of robots...
2120	2123	...are protesting...
2123	2125	...causing minor skirmishes.
2128	2130	This is a golden opportunity!
2130	2134	We could put the law for treason to good use.
2138	2141	Do we have control of the military?
2141	2143	Some units are aligned with Duke Red...
2144	2146	...but it should be fine.
2151	2156	All right, leak some stories. Stir up anti-Duke Red sentiment...
2156	2159	...then we will have him arrested.
2161	2166	If you meet any resistance, mobilize the military!
2175	2178	I believe that he's the one who killed Laughton!
2178	2182	I don't understand the connection between him and Laughton.
2182	2187	What in the world was Laughton experimenting on, I wonder?
2188	2190	What do you intend to do?
2191	2196	Now that Laughton's been killed, I should report why he was killed.
2196	2199	It's the least I can do for my client.
2217	2220	- Where does he think he's going? - Zone 2, I believe.
2221	2225	There are more underground levels? What is up with this city?
2226	2230	Zone 2 is the area for Metropolis' power plants.
2230	2235	Zone 3, below that, is the sewage disposal plant.
2235	2237	Sewage disposal plant?
2237	2239	Actually, he was investigating...
2239	2242	...the water drainage behind the rundown factory.
2245	2248	I'll go to headquarters and get permission to go below.
2249	2252	I'll also submit a search request for Kenichi.
2252	2253	Okay.
2254	2256	You bastard! You're too old for this!
2256	2257	How much?
2260	2263	Well, sure, if there was a strange guy down here, we'd know.
2263	2266	The administration keeps a sharp watch.
2268	2271	- How often are you down here? - Twice a week.
2272	2274	For robot inspection and repairs.
2283	2286	These are the Albert II models.
2286	2289	They're the last group to get inspected.
2308	2310	Is anyone here?
2317	2322	No, this place always smells horrible!
2323	2326	We humans wouldn't last a day down here.
2339	2340	What's the matter?
2340	2343	- Someone's here. - You must be joking!
2344	2346	Hey, what are you doing there?
2347	2349	This area is off-limits!
2350	2352	- They're alive after all. - What?
2352	2353	Hey!
2355	2357	What are you doing?
2357	2360	It doesn't matter. He's a criminal.
2360	2362	Tell us where the exit is!
2365	2369	Stop it! You might hit the equipment!
2378	2380	Are you okay?
2385	2386	Damn!
2396	2399	What'll we do? He's trying to kill us.
2420	2421	Damn.
2435	2437	Move! Move! You're in the way!
2438	2440	Move, you blockhead!
2442	2443	Move!
2475	2477	Is it okay now?
2500	2501	This place looks okay.
2515	2516	What's wrong?
2522	2526	I see. Fifi can't go through the gate.
2527	2530	Thanks for everything, Fifi. Let's meet again.
2532	2533	Move!
2536	2538	It's him!
2569	2572	Carrying firearms is prohibited! Your I.D.?
2573	2575	I'm Rock of the Marduk!
2578	2581	Demonstrations during holidays are prohibited.
2581	2583	Please break up immediately.
2584	2588	I repeat, demonstrations during holidays are prohibited.
2589	2590	Please break up.
2590	2593	- Wait, Kenichi! - Stop!
2595	2596	Pay up!
2629	2632	- I got some good stuff. - No, I don't want it.
2633	2634	Just try some out!
2728	2732	- They're nowhere! - Impossible! Search the entire area!
2764	2766	That means everywhere!
2795	2798	What's going on, Atlas? There was no signal!
2798	2802	We're cancelling today. Those Marduk bastards are everywhere.
2803	2807	- Have we been ratted out? - No, it's because of them.
2808	2810	Rock is looking for them.
2811	2812	Hurry up, you two!
2812	2816	We saw them during the factory fire, didn't we?
2829	2832	What are your names? Where are you from?
2832	2833	My name is Kenichi.
2834	2837	- I came from Japan with the detect... - What?
2837	2842	My uncle is a reporter, I'm helping him.
2844	2848	- Why is Rock after you? - I don't know.
2848	2850	He just started shooting.
2850	2853	Are we supposed to believe you? We should kill them.
2854	2855	Cool it!
2856	2858	We're not a gang.
2858	2860	You heard him, he's a reporter.
2861	2865	He can let the world know about Metropolis.
2866	2868	That's more than we could have hoped for.
2868	2870	It's a time of life or death.
2870	2874	We have no time to get our pictures taken!
2876	2879	But we've got the right to choose how we die.
2879	2882	I want to die as a revolutionary.
2921	2922	Hey, look at that.
2923	2924	She's like an angel.
2925	2927	Yeah, she's an angel.
2935	2939	Around here, two or three families live to a room.
2940	2942	No schools and no work, either.
2943	2945	We live on rations...
2945	2948	...but with the celebration for the Ziggurat...
2948	2950	...we don't even get those.
2952	2954	What does "Ziggurat" mean?
2956	2959	It's the name of a tower built in Babylon.
2959	2964	The most famous was the Tower of Babel. You know what happened to that.
2965	2968	The king of Babylon angered the gods and it was destroyed.
2970	2974	But history repeats itself. Duke Red will suffer the same fate.
2974	2978	And this time, we'll destroy it, not the gods.
3003	3005	Did I make a mistake?
3010	3012	No, that's not it.
3013	3016	Just that your hair has grown.
3017	3020	What kind of hair do you like?
3020	3023	What? I like it the way it is.
3025	3028	Come on, let's practice.
3028	3030	- Okay, next is... - Tima.
3030	3031	What? What's that?
3032	3035	Tima. My name.
3038	3041	I see! You remembered!
3041	3045	That's great, Tima. Soon, you'll remember more stuff.
3047	3050	Thank you, Kenichi.
3057	3062	Oh, I'd forgotten. I borrowed these from Atlas.
3068	3069	Kenichi.
3076	3077	I see.
3077	3080	It would be good if the military helps us.
3080	3083	Most of the underground is in favour of action...
3083	3087	...but everyone's hesitant. We're unsure of our strength.
3087	3092	The last celebration for the Ziggurat begins with the Marduk parade.
3092	3097	That's when we'll crush them, and I want you to storm the Ziggurat.
3098	3101	The president will make an announcement...
3102	3104	...that Duke Red's been arrested for treason.
3105	3107	We'll invoke the right of command...
3107	3110	...and place the military under President Boon.
3112	3117	With that, Metropolis will have a normal government.
3117	3123	And we will be able to participate as a new political party.
3127	3129	Of course, my dear Atlas.
3130	3133	The president will welcome you all.
3135	3137	Damn, I can't believe myself!
3137	3140	I'd finally found him and look what happens.
3141	3145	I am sorry for not being more helpful.
3145	3147	What are you saying?
3147	3152	You've been helpful in this place, I don't know east from west.
3152	3154	Don't worry about Kenichi.
3154	3158	He might not look like much but... What?
3160	3162	Stop that!
3167	3170	What a terrible thing to do!
3188	3191	Be...
3191	3195	... careful.
3196	3200	Hide robots. Hide... Coup d'état.
3210	3211	"Be careful.
3211	3215	Robots, hide. There will be a coup d'état."
3215	3218	What?! A coup d'état?
3268	3270	Watch closely, Kenichi.
3270	3274	I want you to tell the world everything!
3291	3294	Oops! I'm out of breath.
3301	3303	We better get out of here, Pero.
3303	3306	This isn't something we can handle.
3306	3308	Please request backup from HQ.
3308	3311	Wait! I can't just go and leave you here.
3312	3316	The first thing that crowd will do is go after robots like you.
3318	3320	I'll be fine.
3320	3323	- What?! - More importantly...
3323	3327	...I must ensure your safety, since you're not from here.
3327	3329	All right!
3329	3333	Try not to provoke them until I get back! Got it, Pero?!
3348	3349	What's this?
3349	3352	You think you can guard this gate alone?
3352	3356	Demonstrations are prohibited during the celebration.
3356	3357	Please disperse.
3358	3359	Can't do that.
3359	3361	It's almost time.
3361	3366	Why do humans use violence to resolve issues?
3368	3370	Good question.
3370	3374	It's true that's a source of our troubles: Emotions.
3375	3379	We have no choice but to make progress in spite of them.
3379	3383	Because without them we are nothing.
3406	3409	It is almost time for the rally.
3410	3413	When should we announce it?
3413	3416	Things will be settled by 1 p.m.
3416	3419	Perhaps around 3:00 or 3:30.
3425	3427	What is it, minister?
3429	3431	Can't sit still?
3431	3433	Actually, Mr. President, yes.
3433	3435	I have been given an unpleasant task...
3440	3442	What is this?!
3442	3446	Bastards! You're working for Duke Red now!
3448	3452	I am a fair man. To history, that is.
3455	3459	Wait, I can explain...
3510	3511	Why?
3515	3518	Why do robots always get hurt by humans?
3525	3527	They call this a revolution?
3533	3535	The coup d'état has failed.
3535	3540	Metropolis is under martial law in the name of Duke Red.
3540	3545	Disarm yourselves and surrender immediately.
3545	3548	I repeat. The coup d'état has failed.
3548	3553	Metropolis is under martial law in the name of Duke Red.
3553	3557	Disarm yourselves and surrender immediately.
3561	3563	Kenichi!
3563	3566	Hey, Kenichi!
3572	3573	Uncle!
3577	3580	So, you're safe! I'm glad, I'm glad.
3581	3583	Are you okay too, Uncle?
3583	3585	Oh, this is nothing.
3587	3588	Who's that?
3592	3593	Her name is Tima.
3594	3598	She's from the lab, and we've been on the run together.
3598	3601	Tima, let me introduce you. This is my uncle.
3602	3603	Uncle.
3615	3616	Atlas!
3619	3623	We were set up...
3631	3633	So, we meet at last.
3634	3636	Don't move!
3643	3644	Don't resist.
3645	3649	If you hand her over, you might be able to go home alive.
3650	3654	Shut up! You won't keep your word! I know what you're up to.
3665	3667	Why, you little...
3668	3670	Tima, get the gun!
3693	3696	Now, let's have it back.
3696	3699	Don't give it to him!
3713	3715	You sure you can shoot me?
3716	3718	I'm a human, you know!
3722	3723	Rock!
3739	3742	What is going on here?
3743	3745	What have you been doing?
3761	3764	You survived?
3766	3768	What is the meaning of this?!
3769	3772	You said Tima burned in the fire!
3772	3774	You said there were no survivors!
3775	3778	And how do you know about Tima?!
3778	3780	Answer me!
3787	3788	With all due respect...
3789	3793	...you must be the one to sit on the throne.
3794	3796	We can't trust the Ziggurat to a robot!
3796	3799	- We cannot hand the future of... - You fool!
3801	3802	A robot.
3803	3806	Did you think you could manipulate me?!
3807	3811	I trusted you. You took advantage of me! On your feet!
3823	3825	Never show your face around me again!
3830	3833	So, you hired Laughton.
3833	3835	What of it?
3835	3839	I came from Japan to arrest him.
3839	3842	My name is Shunsaku Ban...
3854	3856	Now, get in.
3857	3860	- What about Kenichi? - When our business is done.
3893	3896	I need to see Superintendent Notarlin.
3896	3900	He's been reassigned. There's no replacement yet.
3901	3902	To tell the truth...
3902	3907	...the Marduk Party took my nephew by mistake...
3907	3910	Then make a statement through your embassy!
3932	3937	Presently, we as a nation, are about to touch the heavens!
3938	3941	I'm thrilled to have the honour of announcing...
3941	3945	... the culmination of mankind's scientific achievement!
3946	3948	Our power will shine across the world.
3957	3958	Sake.
3959	3961	Make it a hot one.
3962	3965	We have hot whiskey or gin, Mr. Japanese Detective.
3966	3968	Hot whiskey in a 3l4- pint bottle.
3969	3970	Coming right up.
3970	3974	Idiots, idiots, idiots! To hell with the Ziggurat!
3974	3978	The Marduks are dog shit! Those shits!
3978	3980	Here you go.
3984	3986	Hey, that was Rock.
3987	3989	I heard he left the party.
3989	3991	Never thought he'd be around here.
3992	3994	- Thanks. - Take care.
4035	4039	A man asked me to give this to you.
4040	4044	I refused. He asked me without telling Duke Red or anyone.
4044	4048	I told him I couldn't, but he said his name was Kenichi.
4048	4050	I just couldn't help myself.
4054	4059	"Dear Tima, I'm sorry I can't deliver this in person...
4060	4062	...but I can't move around.
4062	4065	I'll be leaving the country in a little while...
4066	4069	...so I want to see you just one more time."
4100	4102	What is going on, Enmy?
4103	4106	Really, please send her back right away.
4106	4110	If anyone finds out about this, I'll be in trouble!
4110	4113	Don't worry. This won't take long.
4116	4117	I didn't want to do this.
4118	4119	I'll be going now.
4122	4124	You tricked me.
4125	4129	This is the only way I could talk to you.
4130	4131	Where is Kenichi?
4132	4134	Please, let me see him.
4138	4139	Uncanny.
4142	4146	Talking to you, it's hard to believe you're a robot.
4153	4157	There was good reason why Father chose Laughton.
4157	4160	What are you talking about?
4160	4162	You being a robot.
4162	4166	You're wrong. I'm not a robot.
4166	4169	Then what are you? A human?
4173	4174	Then who's your father?
4175	4176	Where is he?
4176	4179	My father is... Kenichi.
4198	4202	And they think a puppet like you could sit on a throne?!
4209	4214	If you don't know anything about Kenichi, then I'm going back now.
4224	4226	What? Tima is gone?
4226	4227	Yes, sir!
4236	4238	You idiot! Watch it!
4286	4290	Let's see the secret behind this superhuman...
4290	4292	...that Father wants so much.
4323	4325	Hang in there, Laughton!
4326	4328	My notebook.
4330	4332	You want that notebook?!
4410	4415	Don't worry. I punished Rock a little.
4416	4417	What about?
4418	4420	I'm looking for Kenichi too.
4420	4423	And that's where I'm going to need your help.
4423	4424	Need?
4424	4429	I think he's being held inside the Ziggurat.
4429	4431	If you connect to the Ziggurat's network...
4432	4435	...you can find out where he is.
4435	4437	I can do that?
4457	4459	Now try putting out your hand.
4526	4527	How was it?
4527	4531	I know where Kenichi is. Inside the tower.
4531	4534	You did it! So he's there, just as I thought!
4537	4539	What did I just do?
4540	4543	Oh, that's right. You don't know what you are.
4544	4545	What do you mean?
4552	4555	Yes, sir. As soon as we find out.
4556	4557	Duke Red?
4559	4560	How is it?
4561	4563	We'll be able to trace the signal.
4563	4567	The power was so intense, the line splitter was burnt out.
4570	4572	- Found it! - Where is it?
4573	4576	Zone 1, South Block 17, "Hotel Coconuts."
4581	4585	Please tell me. Am I a human? Or am I...?
4586	4591	It's true, you're different from the other robots.
4592	4593	No, I'm a human.
4595	4597	A human, just like Kenichi.
4597	4600	Right. Of course you are.
4601	4604	In any case, we have to rescue Kenichi first.
4635	4637	We've been searching for you.
4650	4652	Where were you going?
4652	4655	Explain or I'll have you arrested for kidnapping!
4655	4658	You're asking the wrong man!
4658	4661	Ask your son if you want the real answer.
4663	4665	I don't know what you're up to...
4666	4669	...but I believe you were definitely working...
4669	4671	...with Dr. Laughton.
4671	4675	And his murder was probably instigated by you or Rock.
4676	4678	To keep your secret.
4684	4687	- Take him in. - Yes, sir!
4688	4690	Come this way!
4718	4721	This is the throne that was built just for you.
4722	4725	Soon, you will rule the entire world from here.
4726	4727	I will?
4728	4729	Why?
4729	4734	Because that is your destiny. You will soon understand.
4754	4756	Hang in there, Kenichi!
4756	4759	It's me! Look at me! Hey, Kenichi!
4764	4767	You bastards! What did you do to him?
4767	4768	He's not dying.
4768	4773	We just quieted him down a little.
4777	4781	I'll submit a protest through my embassy regarding this!
4781	4783	- It'll be a diplomatic crisis! - Really?
4784	4788	I had no idea you were such an important figure.
4788	4791	You have my most sincere apology.
4791	4796	But no matter where you are from, everyone will bow before Tima.
4796	4800	- She's growing the way we estimated. - Make Kenichi the way he was.
4802	4805	What's wrong, Tima? Who cares about a little boy?
4806	4809	You possess the power to rule the entire world.
4811	4813	What is my power?
4813	4815	Am I a human?
4817	4820	Or am I a machine just like those poor robots?
4821	4823	What a silly thing to say!
4824	4827	How could you be like those pieces of junk?
4827	4831	Then, I am human, same as Kenichi?
4832	4836	What are you saying?! You are no mere human!
4836	4840	You are not inferior, ruled by emotions...
4840	4842	...confused by love and morality.
4845	4847	You are a superhuman!
4848	4850	Then, I really am.
4851	4854	I have brought Miss Tima's new clothes.
4855	4857	It is true, you are a robot.
4858	4862	You are the greatest, most sublime creation ever!
4868	4869	That is a lie.
4869	4872	I have the love and emotions that you say are human.
4872	4875	You are still not complete.
4875	4880	You just need time. The fluctuations of your power...
4880	4883	...are taking the shape of love and emotions.
4884	4887	One day, you'll merge with that superhuman throne...
4887	4891	...and become a computer weapon that'll rule the world!
4892	4896	Then all your emotions and memories will be completely erased!
4897	4900	And where did you get that information?
4901	4903	I'm still a detective.
4909	4913	It's time to change, Miss Tima.
4915	4918	Father, please open your eyes.
4925	4927	How in the...?
4928	4931	What is the meaning of this?
4934	4937	You must sit on that throne.
4939	4942	You are the only one that can be our leader, Father.
4946	4947	What are you...?
4987	4989	So you're awake.
5013	5016	I am an artificial human.
5016	5019	A machine created to ruin the world.
5021	5024	No, not to ruin! To rebuild!
5024	5025	Stop it!
5088	5092	- Who threw the switch? - It just started by itself!
5092	5097	- Switch to manual and cut the power! - Controls are not responding!
5113	5115	Dr. Ponkotz!
5116	5120	- What's the meaning of this alarm? - The generator is out of control!
5121	5123	- What's going on, doctor? - Well...
5165	5168	Stop this, Tima! You'll destroy the Ziggurat!
5171	5174	This is punishment for fooling with robots.
5178	5181	Tima's memories are merging with our database.
5181	5183	She's beginning to go crazy.
5184	5188	And God's wrath descended on the Tower of Babel.
5190	5194	Don't! She's not Tima anymore!
5204	5206	All right, I understand.
5206	5209	If we don't stop the omotenium generator...
5209	5212	...we will be done for!
5218	5222	In one hour, the probability of mankind's survival will be 30°/°.
5224	5227	I control the Ziggurat, and all Earth weaponry...
5227	5230	...will be activated within 30 minutes.
5230	5231	Oh, my goodness!
5232	5233	Attack targets...
5233	5237	...are the world's major cities and 7586 facilities.
5240	5245	Destruction of humans through irradiation and weapons will occur...
5246	5249	...in 17 hours and 27 minutes.
5251	5254	Did you hear that, Duke Red?
5256	5260	Your superhuman is saying it has no need for humans!
5262	5264	Don't go!
5412	5415	Doctor, we've lost control...
5417	5418	How can this be?
5438	5442	Get out! Robots aren't allowed in here!
5448	5450	Tima, it's me!
5460	5463	Kenichi! It's Kenichi!
5499	5501	Stop!
5503	5505	I won't...
5506	5509	...let pieces of junk like you...
5510	5512	...kill my father!
5683	5685	Tima, grab my hand!
5687	5691	- I'm Kenichi. Who in the world are you? - Who in the world are you?
5691	5696	No. Listen, you refer to yourself as "I."
5699	5701	Hurry, grab my hand!
5701	5704	Who am I?
5817	5820	Where did you find this?
5835	5837	Fifi?
5839	5840	Fifi!
5881	5883	Uncle!
5900	5901	Uncle?
5903	5906	I'd like to stay for a while longer.
5977	5979	Who am I?
