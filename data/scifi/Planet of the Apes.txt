18	22	And that completes my final report until we reach touchdown.
22	26	We're now on full automatic, in the hands of the computers.
26	29	I've tucked my crew in for the long sleep
29	31	and I'll be joining them
31	33	soon.
33	37	In less than an hour we'll finish our sixth month out of Cape Kennedy.
37	40	Six months in deep space.
40	42	By our time, that is.
42	48	According to Dr. Hasslein's theory of time in a vehicle traveling nearly the speed of light,
48	52	the Earth has aged nearly 700 years since we left it,
52	54	while we've aged hardly at all.
57	59	It may be so.
59	61	This much is probably true.
61	65	The men who sent us on this journey are long since dead and gone.
66	69	You who are reading me now are a different breed.
69	72	I hope a better one.
72	75	I leave the 20th century with no regrets, but...
75	77	one more thing.
77	79	If anybody's listening, that is.
79	83	Nothing scientific. It's... purely personal.
84	86	Seen from out here,
87	89	everything seems different.
89	91	Time bends.
91	94	Space is... boundless.
94	97	It squashes a man's ego.
98	101	I feel lonely.
108	110	That's about it.
112	114	Tell me, though...
115	117	Does man, that marvel of the universe,
118	121	that glorious paradox who has sent me to the stars,
121	124	still make war against his brother,
125	128	keep his neighbor's children starving?
417	419	Are you all right?
426	428	Stewart?
430	431	Stewart?
450	452	We're in the soup!
452	455	She's sinking! Dodge, read the atmosphere!
469	472	Landon, get out a last signal!
472	474	What signal?
474	477	To Earth! That we've landed!
517	519	The air's OK!
519	523	Blow the hatch before we lose all our power!
530	532	It's no use! The power's gone!
532	535	Forget it! Abandon ship!
636	638	She's sinking.
642	643	Going...
645	647	Going...
650	651	Gone.
655	657	OK. We're here to stay.
670	672	Well, where are we?
673	675	Do you have any notion, skipper?
675	678	We're some 320 light years from Earth
678	683	on an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.
683	685	Is that close enough for you?
686	688	That could be Bellatrix.
688	691	It's too white for Bellatrix.
691	694	You didn't have time to read the tapes.
694	696	So you really don't know, do you?
696	698	What went wrong?
698	701	We weren't programmed to land in the water.
701	705	The question is not so much where we are as when we are.
705	708	We've had enough sleep to hold us for a while.
709	711	Let's start earning all that back pay.
748	750	Dodge, run your soil test.
752	755	- Got your sensors? - Right.
755	757	- Geiger counter? - Got it.
760	762	Let's see. One pistol,
762	767	20 rounds ammo, a medical kit, camera, TX9.
767	771	We've got food and water enough for three days.
771	773	How long is a day?
773	775	That's a good question.
775	776	Landon!
776	778	Hey, Landon!
778	780	Join the expedition.
783	787	Sorry. I was thinking about Stewart. What do you suppose happened?
787	789	Air leak. She died in her sleep.
789	791	You don't seem very cut up about it.
791	795	It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
795	798	That means we've been away from Earth for 18 months.
798	800	Our time.
801	803	You've gone gray.
805	810	Apart from that you look pretty chipper for a man who's 2,031 years old.
810	813	I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis.
813	817	We have been away from Earth for 2,000 years,
817	819	give or take a decade.
820	822	Still can't accept it?
822	825	Time's wiped out everything you ever knew.
825	827	It's all dust.
827	829	Prove it.
829	832	If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
832	836	It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.
836	840	Nothing will grow here. There's just a trace of carbohydrates.
840	843	All the nitrogen is locked into the nitrates.
843	845	No dangerous ionization?
845	847	No.
848	849	Well...
849	854	If there's no life here, we've got just 72 hours to find it.
854	856	That's when the groceries run out. Let's go.
857	859	Which direction?
860	862	That way.
862	864	Any particular reason?
864	866	None at all.
869	871	Come on...
1033	1035	Everybody all right?
1037	1039	Water check.
1046	1047	Eight ounces.
1054	1056	It doesn't add up.
1056	1058	Thunder and lightning, and no rain.
1058	1060	Cloud cover at night.
1060	1063	That strange luminosity... yet there's no moon.
1063	1065	If we could just get a fix.
1065	1069	What would that tell you? I've told you where you are and when you are.
1069	1071	All right, all right.
1071	1075	You're 300 light years from your precious planet.
1075	1079	Your loved ones are dead and forgotten for 20 centuries.
1079	1084	20! Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
1084	1086	Taylor, quit riding him.
1086	1089	There is just one reality. We are here and it is now.
1089	1091	You get hold of that, or you might as well be dead.
1092	1094	I'm prepared to die.
1096	1099	He's prepared to die.
1099	1101	Doesn't that make you misty?
1101	1104	Chalk up another victory for the human spirit.
1111	1115	Clue me in on something, will you? Why did you sign on for this trip?
1116	1118	You volunteered. Why?
1118	1120	Never mind. I'll clue you in.
1120	1123	You were the golden boy of the class of '72.
1123	1127	When they nominated you for the big one, you couldn't turn it down.
1127	1129	Not without losing your all-American image.
1129	1131	Climb off, will you?
1131	1134	Oh, and the glory. Don't forget that.
1134	1138	There's a life-size bronze statue of you standing out there somewhere.
1138	1142	It's probably turned green by now and nobody can read the nameplate.
1142	1145	But never let it be said that we forget our heroes.
1145	1149	- Taylor, I'm telling you to climb off my back. - And there's one last item.
1149	1152	Immortality. You wanted to live for ever, didn't you?
1152	1154	Well, you damn near made it.
1154	1159	Except for me and Dodge, you've lived longer than anyone ever born.
1159	1165	And with our lovely Lieutenant Stewart dead, it looks like you're the last of the line.
1166	1170	You got what you wanted, tiger. How does it taste?
1171	1173	OK. You read me well enough.
1173	1175	But why can't I read you?
1175	1177	Don't bother.
1177	1179	Dodge, there. He's not like me at all.
1180	1182	But he makes sense.
1182	1184	He'd walk naked into a live volcano
1185	1188	if he thought he could learn something that no other man knew.
1189	1191	But you... You're no seeker.
1191	1193	You're negative.
1193	1197	- And I'm not prepared to die. - I'd like to know why not.
1197	1201	You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people.
1201	1203	So what did you do? You ran out.
1203	1206	No, no. It's not like that, Landon.
1206	1208	I'm a seeker too.
1208	1214	But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking somewhere in the universe
1214	1217	there has to be something better than man. Has to be.
1219	1221	Taylor, over here!
1259	1260	Life.
1274	1276	Where there's one, there's another.
1277	1279	And another and another.
1279	1281	Let's find 'em.
1429	1431	Skipper!
1433	1435	Look!
1449	1451	Scarecrows?
1452	1454	Let's see.
1498	1500	To hell with the scarecrows!
1579	1581	Taylor!
1581	1583	Look at this.
1607	1609	Taylor, look!
1710	1712	They didn't leave much, did they?
1741	1744	Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
1745	1747	Blessed are the vegetarians.
1752	1755	They look more or less human,
1755	1757	but I think they're mute.
1766	1769	We got off at the wrong stop.
1770	1774	You're supposed to be the optimist, Landon. Look on the bright side.
1774	1780	If this is the best they've got around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
2070	2071	Smile.
2109	2112	Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
2113	2115	This one.
2117	2119	Will he live?
2119	2121	I don't know.
2121	2123	This beast has lost a lot of blood.
2130	2132	There's no probe here. Find one!
2132	2134	Yes, sir.
2134	2136	This place is dirty, doctor.
2136	2142	Doctor, these animals are dirty. They stink and they carry communicable diseases.
2142	2145	Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
2145	2150	- You don't sound happy in your work. - I'm little more than a vet in this laboratory.
2150	2153	You promised to speak to Dr. Zaius about me.
2153	2156	I did. You know how he looks down his nose at chimpanzees.
2157	2159	But the quota system's been abolished.
2159	2162	- You made it. Why can't I? - What do you mean - made it?
2162	2166	I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We have no authority.
2166	2169	You do all right when it comes to getting space and equipment.
2169	2173	That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
2173	2178	The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here
2178	2180	in studies of cerebral functions of these animals.
2182	2184	They're still dirty, doctor.
2184	2187	And their bite is septic. There. Look at that.
2188	2190	Hold his jaw.
2215	2217	- Good morning, Dr. Zira. - Good morning, Julius.
2217	2219	- How's our patient today? - No change.
2220	2222	The minute you open the door, he goes into his act.
2225	2226	Well!
2227	2229	And what do we want this morning?
2229	2231	Do we want something? Come on. Speak.
2231	2233	Come on.
2233	2234	Speak.
2234	2236	Do we want some sugar, old-timer?
2239	2241	You could get hurt doing that, doctor.
2241	2243	Oh, don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
2243	2246	They're all tame until they take a chunk out of you.
2246	2250	Well, Bright Eyes. Is our throat feeling better?
2251	2253	Still hurts, doesn't it?
2253	2256	See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
2259	2262	That Bright Eyes is remarkable.
2262	2264	He keeps trying to form words.
2264	2267	You know what they say. Human see, human do.
2272	2273	Now what?
2276	2278	He seems to want something.
2280	2282	I'd be careful, doctor.
2282	2283	What did I tell you?
2283	2285	Try that again and I'll break your arm!
2287	2290	Good morning, Your Excellency.
2290	2292	Dr. Zaius.
2294	2296	Good morning, sir.
2296	2298	Open up, please.
2299	2301	I'm so glad you could come.
2301	2303	Sir, he's over here.
2305	2307	Bright Eyes...
2308	2310	Show him. Go ahead.
2310	2312	Do your trick.
2312	2313	Speak.
2313	2315	Go on. Speak again.
2318	2321	There! Can you believe it?
2321	2323	Yes, amusing.
2323	2325	A man acting like an ape.
2327	2331	Dr. Zaius, I could swear he's answering you.
2331	2334	He has a definite gift for mimicry.
2334	2336	Most unusual.
2336	2339	He's using that old blanket as clothing.
2340	2344	I wonder how he'd score on a Hopkins manual dexterity test.
2344	2346	An animal?
2346	2347	Look!
2347	2349	He's moving his fingers.
2349	2352	Only because he saw you moving yours.
2352	2354	But perhaps he understood.
2355	2358	Man has no understanding.
2358	2361	He can be taught a few simple tricks. Nothing more.
2362	2365	I'm afraid I must disagree.
2365	2369	- According to my experiments... - Dr. Zira, I must caution you.
2369	2373	Experimental brain surgery on these creatures is one thing,
2373	2375	and I'm all in favor of it.
2375	2379	But your behavioral studies are something else again.
2379	2384	To suggest that we can learn anything about the simian nature
2384	2386	from the study of man is sheer nonsense.
2388	2390	Besides, man is a nuisance.
2390	2393	He eats up his food supplies in the forest,
2393	2397	then migrates to our green belts and ravages our crops.
2400	2403	The sooner he is exterminated the better.
2404	2407	It's a question of simian survival.
2419	2421	Is this the one you wanted, doctor?
2422	2424	Oh, yes. Thank you.
2424	2428	Bright Eyes, I've got a present for you.
2438	2440	Put her in with him.
2491	2493	Cornelius! Up here.
2494	2496	Do you have to work tonight?
2497	2498	No.
2498	2500	Neither do I.
2504	2506	Oh, Cornelius.
2521	2523	There's Bright Eyes.
2524	2526	The one I was telling you about.
2526	2529	What's so special about him?
2529	2530	Watch.
2530	2532	Hello, Bright Eyes.
2532	2534	How's our throat today?
2539	2541	- Look! She remembers! - Remembers what?
2542	2544	The blood transfusion.
2544	2545	Zira, really!
2545	2547	You know, they can't... Watch out.
2547	2549	Here comes number one.
2549	2554	Something's bothering him. He's been prying around the lab for the last two days.
2554	2556	Good morning, Dr. Zaius.
2556	2560	- You know my... Dr. Cornelius, my fiancé? - Of course.
2560	2565	The young ape with a shovel. I hear you're planning another archaeological expedition.
2565	2569	- With the Academy's approval, sir. - The project will require my support.
2569	2571	I hope I may count on it, sir.
2571	2574	Cornelius, a friendly warning.
2574	2579	As you dig for artifacts, be sure you don't bury your reputation.
2592	2594	Guard!
2594	2595	Guard!
2617	2618	Stop!
2618	2621	You'll hurt him!
2621	2623	Take him inside.
2625	2628	Cornelius! Cornelius, if you have a moment today,
2628	2632	I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
2632	2636	Certainly, sir. I'll pick up my notes and I'll come right over.
2636	2639	I don't understand these animal psychologists.
2640	2642	What's Dr. Zira trying to prove?
2642	2645	That man can be domesticated.
2682	2685	- What happened? - Oh, those fools and their torches.
2685	2688	- Do you have any ointment? - I'll see.
2692	2695	I'm sorry, Bright Eyes.
2700	2701	Julius!
2704	2706	I told you what you'd get!
2706	2707	Julius, don't, don't, don't!
2708	2709	It doesn't matter!
2709	2711	Julius, don't hurt him!
2714	2715	Julius!
2721	2723	Natural-born thieves, aren't they?
2735	2738	Get me a collar and leash.
2739	2742	- I'm taking him out of here. - He's vicious, doctor.
2742	2745	- Besides, it's against the rules. - Do as I say!
2756	2760	You... you wouldn't hurt me, would you,
2762	2763	Taylor?
2780	2782	It's a stunt.
2782	2784	Humans can't write.
2784	2786	Dear, you're a scientist.
2786	2788	Don't you believe your own eyes?
2792	2794	Where did you learn to do this?
2797	2799	"Jefferson
2799	2802	Public School."
2808	2810	"Fort Wayne,
2810	2812	Indiana."
2815	2817	Back on that planet you say you came from?
2823	2825	Maybe he is intelligent.
2825	2828	But he is also... crazy.
2828	2830	Cornelius.
2830	2832	Cornelius, please.
2836	2839	"Dodge was killed in the hunt."
2839	2842	"What happened to... Landon?"
2844	2846	I don't know.
2846	2849	They fell out of the sky with you?
2853	2855	"Not fell. Flew."
2855	2858	Flight is a scientific impossibility.
2858	2861	And even if it weren't, why fly?
2861	2863	Where would it get you?
2879	2881	"Do you have maps?"
2895	2898	We're here. You were captured here.
2901	2903	You fell into the water here?
2903	2905	You came ashore...
2906	2908	Marched across the desert?
2909	2910	Mountains?
2911	2913	Many days and nights.
2913	2916	And reached the jungle.
2916	2918	Out of the question.
2920	2923	Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
2923	2929	No creature can survive in the forbidden zone. I know. I've been there. I've seen it.
2931	2933	"Then how do you account for me?"
2934	2936	I don't.
2936	2938	And I'm not going to try.
2940	2943	But what about your theory?
2944	2947	The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
2947	2949	Do you want to get my head chopped off?
2949	2953	Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
2953	2955	No, they won't.
2956	2959	Cornelius has developed the most brilliant hypothesis.
2959	2961	But I'm probably wrong.
2961	2965	That the ape evolved from a lower order of primate,
2965	2967	possibly man.
2967	2969	In his trip to the forbidden zone,
2969	2973	he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time.
2973	2977	- The evidence was very meager. - You didn't think so then.
2977	2981	That was before Dr. Zaius and half of the Academy said my idea was heresy.
2981	2984	How can scientific truth be heresy?
2984	2987	What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed?
2987	2989	A mutation.
2989	2993	A missing link between the unevolved primate
2993	2995	and the ape.
2996	2999	Touchy, isn't he?
3000	3002	"I am not a missing link."
3002	3007	Well, if he were a missing link, the sacred scrolls wouldn't be worth their parchment.
3007	3010	Well, maybe they're not.
3010	3014	Oh, no, thank you. I'm not going to get into that battle.
3014	3017	- Cornelius, show some strength! - Zira, listen to me!
3018	3020	Now, we both have fine futures.
3020	3022	Marriage, stimulating careers.
3022	3024	I'm up for a raise.
3025	3027	Dr. Zaius.
3028	3031	Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
3031	3034	No, sir. I was just collecting my notes.
3034	3038	You know Dr. Maximus, of course. Our commissioner for animal affairs.
3038	3041	Yes, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
3041	3043	What is that?
3043	3045	A man, Dr. Maximus.
3045	3048	I know it's a man. And you know the rules.
3048	3053	No animals allowed outside the compound, and most especially not without a leash.
3053	3055	Yes, sir, but... but this
3055	3058	creature is a special case.
3058	3060	Why special?
3061	3063	We're conducting a new experiment.
3063	3066	Wouldn't that more properly be done in your office?
3066	3068	Yes, sir.
3068	3071	Guards, return this beast to the compound.
3072	3073	What is this?
3076	3078	A toy.
3078	3080	It floats on the air.
3080	3082	Zira...
3082	3083	Try it.
3083	3085	Nonsense.
3102	3106	- What's up, lieutenant? - We're taking number four to surgery.
3106	3108	- Have him ready. - How come?
3108	3112	- The beast's throat's nearly healed. - The vet's going to geld him.
3112	3115	Dr. Zira won't like it. She wants that pair to mate.
3115	3120	These orders come from Dr. Zaius himself. There's nothing she can do about it.
3135	3138	If only you knew what they're going to do.
3140	3142	Stay still now. Don't give me any trouble.
3174	3178	Weep if you must, but make an end of sorrow.
3178	3180	He lives again.
3181	3184	Yes, he has found peace in heaven.
3186	3191	He was a model for us all, a gorilla to remember...
3191	3194	Hunter, warrior,
3194	3196	defender of the faith.
3197	3199	Cherished husband,
3199	3201	beloved father,
3201	3204	generous master, yes.
3204	3206	He was
3206	3208	a font of simian kindness.
3210	3216	The dear departed once said to me "I never met an ape I didn't like."
3217	3220	Look! It's a man!
3220	3223	In heaven's name! Get rid of that creature!
3223	3225	Catch him!
3227	3229	Catch him! Catch him!
3316	3317	Come on, Quintus.
3444	3446	- Go get him! - Taylor!
3446	3449	- Why did you run away? - Security police.
3449	3451	I'm in charge of this man.
3451	3453	He is in the custody of the ministry of science.
3453	3456	Take your stinking paws off me,
3456	3458	you damn dirty ape!
3468	3470	No one'll listen to me.
3472	3474	Only you.
3477	3479	You.
3480	3482	Nova.
3482	3484	You... Nova.
3484	3486	No...
3488	3490	Yeah. Me Tarzan, you Jane.
3499	3500	What are you doing?
3500	3502	Leave her alone,
3502	3503	damn you!
3503	3505	Where are you taking her?
3514	3516	Where are you taking her?
3529	3532	Damn you! You hairy scum!
3532	3534	Shut up, you freak!
3534	3536	Julius, you...
3536	3538	I said shut up!
3538	3540	It's a madhouse!
3541	3543	A madhouse!
3554	3556	Now I don't even have you.
3558	3560	Imagine me needing someone.
3560	3564	Back on Earth I never did. Oh, there were women. Lots of women.
3564	3567	Lots of... lovemaking, but no love.
3567	3570	That was the kind of world we'd made.
3570	3572	So I left
3572	3575	because there was no one to hold me there.
3575	3577	Did I tell you about Stewart?
3577	3580	Now there was a lovely girl.
3580	3583	The most precious cargo we'd brought along.
3583	3586	She was... to be the new Eve.
3586	3590	With our hot and eager help, of course.
3591	3594	Probably just as well she didn't make it this far.
3598	3600	Do you love me, I wonder?
3600	3603	Can you love, I wonder?
3609	3611	Well...
3611	3614	You're not as smart as Stewart, but
3615	3617	you're the only girl in town.
3622	3624	Look at that. I...
3625	3627	I taught you to smile.
3707	3711	It's been weeks. What happened? Where have you been?
3711	3713	Why didn't you come to see me?
3713	3715	- What is this? - A hearing.
3715	3718	- Be clever. Be quiet. - All rise!
3727	3728	Be seated!
3731	3734	This ad hoc tribunal of the National Academy is now in session.
3735	3737	The president of the Academy presiding.
3737	3742	On my right, Dr. Maximus, commissioner for animal affairs. And on my left,
3742	3747	Dr. Zaius, minister of science and chief defender of the faith.
3747	3751	And appearing for the state, Dr. Honorious, deputy minister of justice.
3755	3759	Bailiff! Your instructions: To clean up the beast.
3759	3764	These rags he's wearing give off a stench that's offensive to the dignity
3764	3766	of this tribunal.
3774	3776	You may proceed,
3776	3779	- Dr. Honorious. - By your leave, Mr. President,
3779	3784	this tribunal has not yet defined the purpose for this inquiry.
3785	3789	You asked for the opportunity to present your case.
3789	3791	Surely you must know why you're here.
3791	3796	At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
3796	3797	Objection!
3797	3800	This exhibit is indeed a man.
3800	3802	Therefore he has no rights under ape law.
3803	3806	Dr. Zira, this is a man,
3806	3810	- is it not? - He is unlike any man you have ever seen.
3810	3812	As we hope to prove.
3812	3815	Answer the question, Dr. Zira. Is it a man?
3815	3819	Sir, perhaps the... question is the point at issue.
3819	3822	Is he a man, is he a deviant,
3822	3824	or... a freak of nature?
3824	3826	- Objection! - Sustained.
3826	3829	Now, Dr. Zira, in all fairness,
3829	3832	you must admit that the accused is a non-ape
3832	3834	and therefore has no rights under ape law.
3834	3836	Then why is he called the accused?
3837	3840	Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
3842	3846	The creature's not being tried. He's being disposed of.
3846	3850	It is scientific heresy that is being tried here.
3850	3852	Well put, Dr. Zaius.
3852	3854	Let us warn our friends
3854	3858	that they endanger their own careers by defending this animal.
3860	3862	Then I'll... defend myself.
3865	3868	Dr. Zira, would you tell
3868	3870	Bright Eyes to be quiet?
3870	3873	- My name is Taylor! - Bailiff! Silence the animal!
3874	3876	Wait! Let me...
3879	3881	You may proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.
3881	3884	Learned judges, my case is simple.
3884	3887	It is based on our first article of faith.
3887	3890	That the almighty created the ape in his own image.
3890	3893	That he gave him a soul and a mind.
3893	3898	That he set him apart from the beasts of the jungle and made him the lord of the planet.
3898	3900	These sacred truths are self-evident.
3901	3904	The proper study of apes is apes.
3906	3909	But certain young cynics have chosen to study man.
3909	3915	Yes! Perverted scientists who advance an insidious theory called evolution.
3916	3918	Come to the point, Dr. Honorious.
3918	3922	The state charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen
3922	3925	experimented on this wounded animal,
3925	3930	tampering with his brain and throat tissues, to produce a speaking monster.
3930	3932	That's a lie!
3932	3933	Mind your tongue, madam.
3933	3936	Did we create his mind as well?
3936	3938	Not only can this man speak,
3938	3941	he can think! He can reason.
3943	3945	That can reason?
3945	3950	With the tribunal's permission, allow me to expose this hoax by direct examination.
3951	3954	Proceed, doctor. But do not turn this hearing into a farce.
3961	3965	Tell the court, Bright Eyes, what is the second article of faith?
3966	3969	I know nothing of your culture. I admit that.
3969	3973	Of course he doesn't know our culture, because he cannot think!
3974	3978	Tell us... Why are all apes created equal?
3979	3982	Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
3982	3983	Ridiculous!
3983	3985	Tell us, Bright Eyes.
3985	3987	Why do men have no souls?
3987	3991	What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
4000	4002	Read this for me.
4012	4016	Since the defendant has been forbidden to speak in his own defense,
4016	4019	he requests that the following statement
4019	4021	be read into the record.
4021	4024	You read it, Dr. Cornelius. Read it.
4027	4032	"I have, uh, come to you from a planet in a different solar system."
4032	4034	"I am an explorer in space..."
4034	4037	Stop right there. Let me see that paper.
4043	4045	It's a joke.
4046	4048	In very poor taste.
4048	4050	Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
4051	4052	Dr. Zira,
4052	4057	you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
4058	4061	You state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions with him
4061	4063	at the time of his capture.
4063	4065	That is his assertion.
4065	4067	Mr. President,
4067	4072	in addition to Bright Eyes, I believe the prosecutor has reassembled
4072	4076	all the surviving humans that were captured in the hunt.
4076	4078	That's true, Dr. Zaius.
4078	4080	Very well.
4080	4083	Then I suggest that we... go take a look at 'em.
4120	4122	That's him! That's Landon!
4122	4124	- Which one? - The tall one in the back.
4126	4130	Do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
4130	4133	- With one of them, yes. - Identify him, then. Speak to him.
4135	4137	Landon?
4138	4139	Landon.
4144	4147	Oh! They cut him!
4149	4151	Did you know about this?
4151	4155	No. I... I swear. I never saw this man before.
4155	4157	But they...
4158	4160	You did it.
4161	4164	You cut up his brain, you bloody baboon!
4164	4166	Stop him!
4176	4178	Take him inside!
4218	4221	Mr. President, a word of explanation.
4221	4223	The human specimen you saw outside
4223	4227	suffered a skull fracture in the course of the hunt.
4227	4232	Two fine veterinary surgeons under my direction were able to save his life.
4232	4234	But the beast could not speak, of course.
4234	4236	Nor will he ever speak.
4237	4239	You did that to him, damn you!
4239	4242	Cut out his memory, took his identity, and that's what you wanna do to me!
4242	4244	Bailiff! Gag the animal!
4244	4246	Damn you!
4248	4250	May it please the tribunal,
4250	4254	I grant you that this creature cannot have come from another planet.
4254	4258	But this much is certain. He does come from somewhere in the forbidden zone.
4258	4263	He's described the region to us and described it accurately for... I have been there.
4263	4265	You visited the forbidden zone?
4265	4266	Yes, sir.
4266	4269	A year ago. With the permission of the Academy.
4269	4273	He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was canceled immediately.
4273	4275	Yes, sir. That is true, thanks to you.
4275	4278	But not before I discovered evidence
4278	4282	of a simian culture that existed long before the sacred scrolls were written.
4282	4286	Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant!
4286	4292	Sustained. Your archaeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
4292	4294	Let them talk, Mr. President. Let them talk.
4295	4299	Sirs, our theories have a bearing on his identity.
4299	4301	How so?
4301	4304	Let us assume, as common sense dictates,
4304	4307	that the prisoner's story is false.
4307	4311	But if he did not come from another planet,
4311	4313	then surely he sprang from our own.
4315	4318	Yes! Sprang! As an animal psychologist,
4318	4323	I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
4323	4325	- Objection! - Sustained!
4325	4330	Their speech organs are adequate. The flaw lies not in anatomy, but in the brain.
4330	4332	- Objection! - Sustained!
4332	4336	Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
4336	4338	Yes! Behold this marvel!
4338	4340	This living paradox!
4340	4343	This missing link in an evolutionary chain!
4343	4345	Silence there!
4345	4346	You go too far.
4346	4348	I think an indictment is in order.
4348	4353	Yes, sir. The state charges Drs Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this tribunal,
4354	4356	malicious mischief, and scientific heresy.
4356	4358	It is so ordered.
4359	4363	This tribunal will examine the evidence and in due course render its verdict.
4363	4366	As to the proposed indictment and as to the disposition
4366	4369	of the deviate in question,
4369	4370	this hearing is adjourned.
4416	4418	Wait outside.
4429	4431	Well, the verdict is in.
4432	4438	At the moment, your two simian friends and sponsors are free on bail.
4438	4441	But they'll soon be brought to trial for heresy.
4441	4443	What about me?
4443	4446	Your case was preordained.
4446	4449	In a way, you did the state a service
4449	4454	because you made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.
4454	4458	Now the tribunal has placed you in my custody
4458	4460	for final disposition.
4461	4463	Do you realize what that means?
4464	4466	No.
4466	4468	Emasculation to begin with.
4468	4470	Then experimental surgery
4470	4473	on the speech centers - on the brain.
4473	4476	Eventually a kind of living death.
4478	4480	However,
4481	4484	I have it in my power to grant a reprieve.
4485	4487	That is why I summoned you here tonight.
4489	4493	Tell me who and what you really are and where you came from,
4493	4495	and no veterinary shall touch you.
4495	4498	I told you that at that hearing of yours.
4498	4500	You lied!
4500	4502	Where is your tribe?
4502	4504	My tribe!
4504	4507	They live on another planet in another solar system.
4507	4511	Even in your lies, some truth slips through.
4511	4515	That mythical community you're supposed to come from - Fort Wayne.
4515	4517	- What about it? - A fort!
4518	4521	Unconsciously you chose a name that was belligerent.
4521	4523	Where were you nurtured?
4524	4531	Then... you don't believe that prosecutor's charge that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira?
4531	4533	Certainly not.
4535	4537	You're a mutant.
4537	4541	That's what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
4541	4543	Of course!
4543	4547	Suppose I am a mutant. How can the appearance of one mutant
4547	4550	- send you into a panic? - Because you're not unique.
4550	4554	- There's the one you call Landon. - Oh. Then you admit that...
4554	4558	I admit that where there's one mutant, there's probably another and another.
4558	4560	A whole nest of them.
4560	4563	Where is your nest, Taylor?
4563	4565	Where are your women?
4565	4567	Thank you.
4567	4569	Thank you for calling me Taylor.
4569	4571	Dr. Zaius,
4571	4573	I know who I am.
4573	4575	But who are you?
4575	4579	How in hell did this upside-down civilization get started?
4579	4582	You may well call it upside down,
4582	4584	since you occupy its lowest level.
4585	4587	And deservedly so.
4589	4592	Our eastern desert has never been explored
4592	4597	because we've always assumed that life cannot exist there.
4597	4600	Taylor, save yourself!
4600	4605	Tell me, is there another jungle beyond the forbidden zone?
4605	4607	I don't know.
4607	4612	If you're trying to protect others of your kind, it'll cost you your identity.
4612	4614	I'm not protecting anyone.
4614	4616	This whole thing is insane! What have I done?
4622	4624	You are a menace.
4625	4627	A walking pestilence!
4627	4630	I do know who you are, Taylor.
4632	4635	I'll give you just six hours to make a full confession.
4635	4638	After that I shall use surgery to obtain one.
4638	4639	Guards!
4639	4643	All right. You can cut pieces out of me. You've got the power.
4643	4645	Return this creature to his cage.
4645	4647	But you do it out of fear!
4647	4652	Remember that! Because you're afraid of me! What are you afraid of, doctor?
4673	4675	Are you Julius?
4675	4679	- Who are you? - I'm from the office of animal affairs.
4681	4683	That male is to be transferred to the zoo.
4683	4685	At this hour?
4685	4687	Who says so?
4687	4689	Don't they tell you anything?
4689	4693	The antivivisectionist society is up in arms.
4693	4697	They're gonna save this beast from those butchers in the lab.
4697	4701	If he can speak, he belongs in a public zoo, but what'll probably happen
4701	4705	is some money-mad grown-up'll put him in a circus, and we'll have to pay...
4705	4708	Stop making speeches and show me the order!
4723	4726	This order's no good.
4727	4729	It must be countersigned by Dr. Zaius.
4730	4731	Grab him!
4737	4738	Who are you?
4738	4740	So you can talk!
4740	4743	I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea.
4743	4745	You're not really going to the zoo.
4746	4748	That's our story if somebody stops us.
4748	4750	Get me out of this.
4752	4754	We've gotta move fast!
4757	4758	She comes along too.
4758	4761	- Zira doesn't want your female. - I want her.
4762	4765	If you insist, but I'm not taking any orders.
4765	4767	All right. Come on! Let's go!
4789	4793	- I told you not to bring the other one! - He wouldn't leave her.
4793	4795	Oh, all right. Come on!
4802	4805	- Here. Put this on. - Don't you have any clothes for me?
4805	4808	What do you expect? An ape's new suit?
4809	4812	- This stuff stinks! - Well, so do you. Like all men.
4812	4814	Taylor, remember,
4814	4816	all men look alike to most apes.
4816	4820	So put it on and keep quiet, and we may just get away with this. Hurry!
4869	4871	Cornelius!
4880	4881	How'd it go?
4883	4884	Come on!
4884	4886	Let me out of this!
4895	4897	Well, Taylor, we're all fugitives now.
4898	4900	Do you have any weapons? Any guns?
4900	4902	The best. But we won't need them.
4902	4905	I'm glad to hear it. I want one anyway.
4913	4916	Taylor, I'm in charge of this expedition!
4916	4919	Good for you. But you're not in charge of me. Not any more.
4919	4921	I don't plan to be caught again.
4923	4926	- As you wish. - Dr. Zaius seemed to think there was
4927	4929	another jungle beyond the forbidden zone.
4929	4931	I'll try for that. What about you?
4931	4934	Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy.
4934	4938	Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
4938	4940	You're going back to the forbidden zone?
4940	4944	We're going back to the diggings I worked at over a year ago.
4944	4946	It's a three-day ride across the desert.
4946	4949	Near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
4949	4953	- You still don't believe me, do you? - It's a long detour to Dead Lake.
4953	4955	- What would we find? - Nothing much.
4955	4960	An empty rubber life raft. Maybe a... little flag, the emblem of my countrymen.
4961	4963	The terrain around that lake
4963	4967	is poisonous. There's no fresh water, no vegetation - nothing.
4971	4975	Anyway, I... ought to thank you for saving me. You'll be in trouble for that.
4976	4979	We've been in trouble since the moment we met you.
4983	4985	What's she pointing at?
4985	4988	This must be close to home for her. She knows it.
4992	4994	Nova, no. Nova!
4994	4997	Nova, you can't go there! It's not safe! Nova!
5001	5005	We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far.
5005	5009	Right. Let's get the water and provisions into the wagon.
5078	5080	Cornelius!
5083	5085	Where does this river lead to?
5085	5090	It flows into a sea some miles from here. That's where we'll find the diggings.
5090	5092	And beyond that?
5092	5096	I don't know. You can't ride along the shore at high tide
5096	5099	and we had no boats on our last expedition.
5099	5102	You never told me - why do you call this the forbidden zone?
5103	5108	No one knows. It's an ancient taboo, set forth in the sacred scrolls.
5109	5112	The lawgiver pronounced this whole area deadly.
5114	5116	Shouldn't we be moving on?
5116	5118	I'm for that.
5203	5205	Well? Do you like it?
5210	5213	Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
5213	5216	In my world, when I left it, only kids your age wore beards.
5217	5219	Beards?
5219	5221	I don't go in for fads.
5222	5224	Somehow
5224	5226	it makes you look less intelligent.
5227	5230	When will you show me what's in that cave?
5230	5232	Right now, if you like.
5251	5252	Cornelius!
5262	5265	- Lucius, don't fire at them! - You're all under arrest!
5270	5275	If there's any more shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to go. You can count on it.
5275	5277	You are not in command. Put down that gun.
5277	5278	Shut up!
5279	5280	Very well.
5281	5282	Lower your weapons.
5282	5285	Tell them to pull back around the rocks, out of range.
5286	5288	Withdraw!
5293	5295	How did you know we'd come here?
5295	5299	It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate would flee to the forbidden zone.
5299	5302	And only a fool would give a gun to an animal.
5303	5306	I see you've brought the female of your species.
5306	5310	I didn't realize that man could be monogamous.
5310	5312	On this planet it's easy.
5313	5317	I'll ask you to reconsider the rash course you've undertaken.
5317	5322	If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years, but
5322	5327	if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
5327	5330	We never meant to be treasonous, sir.
5330	5334	But up there, in the face of that cliff, there is a vast cave,
5334	5338	and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
5338	5342	I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
5342	5344	There's your minister of science.
5344	5347	Honor-bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
5347	5350	- Taylor, please! - Except he's also chief defender of the faith.
5350	5355	There is no contradiction between faith and science - true science.
5355	5358	- Are you willing to put it to the test? - Taylor, I would rather...
5358	5362	Take it easy. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can return the favor.
5362	5364	What is your proposal?
5365	5368	When were those sacred scrolls of yours written?
5368	5370	1,200 years ago.
5370	5375	All right. If they can prove those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history,
5375	5377	if they can find some real evidence
5377	5381	of another culture from some remote past, will you let them off?
5381	5384	- Of course. - Let's go up to the cave.
5389	5392	Sorry, Lucius. You've got to stay here and guard the camp.
5392	5395	Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
5395	5397	Relax. You'll get to see it all later on.
5457	5459	Present your evidence, Cornelius.
5460	5465	It was at this level that I discovered traces of an early ape creature.
5465	5470	A stage of primitive barbarism really, dating back some 1,300 years roughly.
5470	5476	It was at this level... I discovered cutting tools and arrowheads of quartz
5476	5479	and the fossilized bones of carnivorous gorillas.
5480	5482	But the artifacts
5482	5484	Lying here
5485	5488	were found at this level,
5488	5491	and date back... 700 years earlier.
5491	5493	That's the paradox.
5493	5497	For the more ancient culture is the more advanced.
5497	5501	Now, admittedly, many of these objects are unidentified.
5501	5505	But clearly they were fashioned by beings with a knowledge of metallurgy.
5505	5509	Indeed, the fact that many of these tools are unknown to us
5509	5513	suggests a culture which in certain ways equals our own.
5513	5516	Some of the evidence is uncontestable.
5516	5520	Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable!
5521	5522	I apologize, sir.
5523	5527	To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude to say the least.
5527	5530	There are geologists on my staff who'd laugh at your speculations.
5530	5532	But there's the doll, sir.
5533	5535	What?
5535	5537	Oh, lying right there. The human doll.
5543	5548	What does this prove? My granddaughter plays with human dolls.
5549	5552	The doll was found beside the jawbone of a man
5552	5556	and no trace of simian fossil has been found in this deposit.
5556	5558	Your conclusion is premature.
5558	5561	Have you forgotten your scripture? The 13th scroll?
5561	5566	"And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden and chained him to a tree,
5566	5570	- and the children did make sport of him." - No, sir, I have not forgotten.
5570	5574	Well, for a time the ancients kept humans as household pets
5574	5578	until our lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed.
5579	5584	Keep digging, Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house...
5585	5588	An ape.
5590	5591	What are you doing?
5591	5594	Reconstructing a past life.
5596	5599	You say these things were found at the same level as that doll?
5599	5603	Whoever owned them must have been in pretty bad shape.
5603	5605	He wore false teeth.
5606	5608	And eyeglasses.
5609	5611	He had a failing heart.
5612	5616	Towards the end, he... had this prefabricated valve put in it.
5618	5620	I don't say he was a man like I knew at home,
5621	5624	but he must have been a close relative. He had all the same weaknesses.
5625	5627	He was a weak,
5627	5629	fragile animal.
5630	5632	But he was here before you
5632	5634	and he was better than you are.
5634	5639	That's lunacy! I can offer alternate descriptions of every one of those articles
5639	5642	which is just as ingenious as yours.
5642	5645	But it'd be conjecture, not proof.
5645	5647	Mamma!
5654	5656	Mamma!
5658	5662	Dr. Zaius, would an ape make a human doll
5662	5663	that talks?
5668	5669	Lucius!
5672	5674	You dirty...
5674	5675	Nova!
5694	5696	Nova!
5732	5734	Cornelius!
5734	5735	Zira!
5735	5737	Help me!
5739	5741	Mamma!
5748	5750	I oughta kill you right now.
5750	5751	Come on!
5753	5755	Tell 'em to pull back. Now!
5755	5757	Cease fire! Withdraw!
5759	5760	Up there!
5760	5762	Withdraw!
5765	5767	Get down!
5779	5781	Lucius, are you all right?
5782	5784	They took me by surprise.
5784	5787	Sneaked up on me while I was feeding the horses.
5787	5789	What's happened to honor?
5791	5793	I got off two rounds to warn you.
5793	5796	- They've taken everything. - Not quite everything!
5796	5799	They left a hostage behind.
5799	5802	- How are you feeling? - Disillusioned.
5802	5804	You can't trust the older generation.
5805	5807	I know what you mean.
5807	5811	I want you to go round the rocks and tell those gorillas I've got Dr. Zaius prisoner.
5811	5813	Yes, I can do that.
5813	5817	I want a horse, food, and water. Enough for a week for me and this female.
5817	5821	- And 50 rounds of ammunition. - What if they won't agree to your terms?
5821	5823	Tell them I'll shoot him.
5823	5825	Taylor, you can't!
5825	5827	Oh, yes, he can.
5828	5830	He's a born killer.
5830	5832	Deliver the message.
5834	5836	Over here.
5839	5841	Sit down.
5857	5861	Taylor, please! Don't treat him like that!
5861	5863	- Why not? - It's humiliating.
5864	5868	The way I was humiliated... by all of you?
5868	5870	You led me around on a leash!
5870	5873	That was different. We thought you were inferior.
5873	5875	Now you know better.
5875	5878	Cornelius was right, doctor. He proved it.
5878	5882	Man was here first. You owe him your science, your culture,
5882	5885	- whatever civilization you've got. - Then answer me this.
5885	5889	If man was superior, why didn't he survive?
5889	5893	Wiped out by a plague, some natural catastrophe, a storm of meteors.
5893	5897	From the looks of some parts of this planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
5897	5898	But we can't be sure.
5898	5900	He is.
5900	5904	He knew all the time. Long before you found your cave, he knew.
5904	5908	Defender of the faith? Guardian of the terrible secret.
5908	5912	- That's it, isn't it, doctor? - What I know of man was written long ago.
5912	5916	Set down by the greatest ape of all, our lawgiver.
5916	5917	Cornelius,
5917	5919	come here.
5919	5922	Reach into my pocket. Read to him
5922	5924	the 29th scroll.
5924	5926	6th verse.
5929	5933	"Beware the beast man, for he is the devil's pawn."
5933	5936	"Alone among God's primates,
5936	5940	he kills for sport or lust or greed."
5941	5945	"Yea, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land."
5945	5948	"Let him not breed in great numbers,
5948	5952	for he will make a desert of his home and yours."
5952	5954	"Shun him."
5954	5957	"Drive him back into his jungle lair."
5957	5960	"For he is the harbinger of death."
5962	5965	I found nothing in the cave to alter that conception of man
5965	5967	and I still live by its injunction.
5976	5978	That's far enough!
5984	5987	They think you're behaving foolishly.
5987	5989	I must say, I agree!
5990	5992	Where will you go?
5992	5995	To start with, I'll follow the shoreline and my nose.
5995	5998	But suppose you find nothing but... but wasteland?
5998	6000	How will you survive?
6000	6002	He won't survive.
6007	6009	Nova.
6011	6013	How about coming along?
6013	6017	- We can't. - It's better than going to jail for heresy.
6017	6019	Oh, they can't convict us of heresy.
6019	6021	You've helped prove our innocence.
6021	6024	Besides... his culture
6024	6026	is our culture.
6026	6029	Well, good luck, then.
6034	6037	Lucius.
6037	6039	I still say you're making a mistake.
6039	6041	That's the spirit. Keep 'em flying.
6041	6044	- What? - The flags of discontent.
6044	6047	Remember, never trust anybody over 30.
6047	6050	Doctor, I'd like to kiss you goodbye.
6057	6059	All right, but
6059	6061	you're so damned ugly.
6086	6089	Don't try to follow us. I'm pretty handy with this.
6089	6091	Of that I'm sure.
6091	6096	All my life I've awaited your coming and dreaded it, like death itself.
6097	6098	Why?
6098	6102	I've terrified you from the first, doctor. I still do.
6102	6104	You're afraid of me and you hate me. Why?
6104	6107	Because you're a man.
6107	6109	And you're right.
6109	6111	I have always known about man.
6112	6118	From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy.
6118	6120	His emotions must rule his brain.
6120	6123	He must be a warlike creature who gives battle
6124	6126	to everything around him, even himself.
6126	6129	What evidence? There were no weapons in that cave.
6130	6133	The forbidden zone was once a paradise.
6133	6137	Your breed made a desert of it... ages ago.
6137	6139	It still doesn't give me the why.
6139	6142	A planet where apes evolved from men.
6143	6145	There's gotta be an answer.
6145	6147	Don't look for it, Taylor.
6148	6150	You may not like what you find.
6158	6160	Untie me!
6174	6176	No, no, no! Wait!
6176	6178	Wait!
6178	6180	Let him go!
6181	6185	Lieutenant, fetch your explosives. We're going to seal up the cave.
6185	6187	Yes, sir!
6187	6189	- Seal the cave? - That is correct.
6189	6191	And you will both stand trial for heresy.
6192	6195	- But the proof! The doll! - In a few minutes there will be no doll.
6196	6198	There can't be. I'm sorry.
6198	6199	Dr. Zaius!
6199	6201	Dr. Zaius, you mustn't! You promised!
6201	6203	What I do, I do with no pleasure.
6204	6206	- Silence him! - Doctor.
6206	6209	Dr. Zaius, this is inexcusable!
6209	6212	Why must knowledge stand still?
6212	6214	What about the future?
6215	6217	I may just have saved it for you.
6220	6222	What will he find out there, doctor?
6223	6226	His destiny.
6351	6353	Oh, my God!
6353	6355	I'm back!
6357	6359	I'm home.
6359	6361	All the time, it was...
6363	6365	We finally really did it.
6366	6368	You maniacs!
6370	6372	You blew it up!
6372	6374	God damn you!
6375	6379	God damn you all to hell!
