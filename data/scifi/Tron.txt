53	55	All right, give me room. Here we go.
68	71	- What's this game called? - This is Lightcycle.
87	89	Damn!
104	108	You're getting brutal, Sark. Brutal and needlessly sadistic.
108	110	Thank you, Master Control.
110	113	We've kidnapped some military programmes.
113	117	I can arrange more lethal matches. Interested?
117	121	Sure. I'd love to go up against one of those guys.
121	125	Make a nice break from those accounting cream puffs you keep sending me.
125	130	- What branch of the service? - Strategic Air Command.
130	132	- Nice. - Hey, look.
133	135	This is all a mistake.
135	138	I'm just a compound interest programme.
138	141	I work at a savings and loan. I can't play these video games.
141	144	Sure, you can, pal. You look like a natural athlete if I ever saw one.
144	149	Who, me? Are you kidding? No. I run out to check on T-bill rates, I get out of breath.
149	152	Hey, look, you guys are gonna make my user, Mr Henderson, very angry.
152	156	- He's a full branch manager. - Great. Another religious nut.
160	163	I'd say "welcome, friend," but not here, not like this.
163	165	I don't even know what I'm doin' here.
169	172	- Do you believe in the users? - Yeah, sure.
172	174	I- If I don't have a user, then who wrote me?
174	177	That's what you're doin' here. Master Control Programme's been snapping up...
177	179	all us programmes who believe.
179	182	If he thinks you're useful, he takes over all your functions so he gets bigger...
183	185	and if he can't use you, he sends you down here to the game grid...
185	187	to get the bits blasted out of you.
187	190	- What's your name? - Crom.
190	192	I'm Ram.
192	194	They'll train you for the games, but-
196	199	I hope you make it.
199	204	Hey, uh, what's been goin' on in the other sectors? You know, I've been stuck here for 200 microcycles.
206	209	It's murder out there. You can't even travel around your own microcircuits...
209	213	without permission from Master Control Programme.
213	217	I mean, sending me down here to play games. Who does he calculate he is?
224	227	Okay, CLU, tonight we check everything in the right-hand column.
230	232	Come on. Come on.
232	234	Where are you? There you are. CLU.
234	236	- Yes, sir? - CLU, we don't have much time left to find that file.
236	238	- This is top priority. - Yes, sir. I know, sir.
238	241	This isn't just correcting my bank statement or phone bill problem again. This is a must.
241	243	- I understand, sir. Yes, sir. - Now, I wrote you.
243	245	- I taught you everything I know about the system. - Thank you, sir.
245	248	- But I'm not sure- - No "buts," CLU. That's for users.
248	251	Now you're the best programme that's ever been written. You're dogged and relentless, remember?
251	254	- Let me at 'em. - That's the spirit. Now keep that tank rolling.
254	256	I'll try to cover you from this end. Go.
275	277	Do you think we can merge with this memory, Bit?
279	280	Yes.
287	291	Now Flynn is saying to look over in here, but I don't see what we're looking for.
298	301	Come on, you scuzzy data. Be in there. Come on.
308	311	Uh-oh. We've got company.
316	318	I don't believe this.
319	323	- A Recognizer. - Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
332	335	There's too many of them!
355	358	What is this?
373	376	Damn it!
379	381	- Get out of here! - Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
395	397	Busted again.
397	400	God. And that was my best programme.
410	414	Got a pirate programme here. Says his name's CLU.
414	418	- What did he pull? - Came into the system with a stolen password...
418	421	and we caught him tryin' to raid a high-clearance memory.
421	424	No. I must've gotten in there by mistake. I was-
425	427	- Who programmed you? - I was simp-
436	440	You're in trouble, programme. Make it easy on yourself. Who's your user?
440	443	Forget it, mister high-and-mighty Master Control!
445	447	You aren't makin' me talk.
450	451	Suit yourself.
464	466	Get me Dillinger.
517	520	- Good evening, Mr Dillinger. - Thank you, Peter. You can go now.
520	521	Yes, sir.
542	545	Hello, Mr Dillinger. Thanks for coming back early.
545	547	No problem, Master C.
548	551	If you've seen one consumer electronic show, you've seen them all. What's up?
551	555	It's your friend, the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
555	557	- Flynn? - Yes.
557	560	- It felt like Flynn. - He's still looking for that old file.
560	563	- Can't you just appropriate it? - I have.
563	566	I put in my memory which he hasn't located.
566	569	- But he might find it. - I'm afraid so.
569	571	I spotted him this time and kept him out...
571	574	but he's getting trickier all the time.
574	579	I think we should shut down all access until we find that Flynn, just to be safe.
579	583	There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
583	585	- Cute. - End of line.
612	617	"Your access suspended"? "Report to Dillinger"? Come on.
617	620	Hey, Alan? You think I could have some of your popcorn?
620	622	Yeah, sure.
624	626	I don't know what he'd want to see me for. What did I do?
651	654	- Sit down. - Thank you.
659	663	We've had to shut down all Group 7 personnel, just briefly. Security.
663	665	Someone with that access has been tampering.
665	667	Well, I hope you don't think it's me.
667	671	I don't even balance my cheque book on down time. I have an abacus at home for that.
671	674	Oh, yes, I'm sure. You understand. It should only be a couple of days.
674	678	- Uh, what's the project you're working on? - Well, it's called Tron.
678	680	It's a security programme itself, actually.
680	684	It monitors all contacts between our system and other systems.
684	687	Finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down.
688	691	- I sent you a memo on it. - Part of the Master Control Programme?
691	694	No. No, it'll, it'll run independently...
695	697	and watchdog the MCP as well.
697	700	Sounds good.
700	703	Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
705	707	Okay.
708	710	Thanks.
723	728	- Oh, boy. - Mr Dillinger, I'm so very disappointed in you.
728	730	- I'm sorry. - I can't afford...
730	733	to have an independent programmer monitoring me.
733	736	Do you realize how many outside systems I've gone into?
737	739	How many programmes I've appropriated?
739	741	Come on.
743	745	Couple of days!
794	798	- Well, here goes nothing. - Yeah. Interesting. Interesting.
798	801	Did you hear what you just said? "Here goes nothing. "
801	803	- Well, what I meant was- - Actually, what we propose to do...
803	806	is to change something into nothing and back again.
806	808	Then you might just as well have said, "Here goes something.
809	811	- Here comes nothing. " - Right. Mm-hmm.
811	813	Let's clear the area.
817	819	Yeah. This is the big moment.
819	821	I know this'll nail down your theory that the scanned UV beam...
822	824	is superior to that single-pulse exposure.
824	827	Laser activity will exist in 30 seconds.
828	830	Put on your goggles.
830	833	- Leave the bay in your own- - Let's see if we got the green light.
833	835	Is the target area sufficiently shielded?
835	839	- Yeah, they verified the safety- - Twenty seconds.
839	841	- Looks good. - Let her rip.
841	843	- Fifteen seconds. - This is what we've been waiting for.
845	848	Ten seconds.
850	852	Five seconds.
868	870	Perfect.
870	873	- Congratulations. - Beautiful.
873	875	- Hi, Alan. - You two having fun...
875	877	- disintegrating things down here? - Not disintegrating, Alan.
877	880	Digitizing. A laser dismantles...
880	883	the molecular structure of the object...
883	886	and, uh, molecules remain suspended in the laser beam.
886	888	Then when the computer plays out the model...
888	891	like the molecules fall back into place and voila!
891	894	Mmm. Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
894	897	Yeah, but you gotta purchase your programme 30 days in advance.
899	901	How's it goin' upstairs?
901	903	Frustrating.
903	905	I had Tron almost ready when Dillinger cut everyone...
906	908	with Group 7 access out of the system.
908	911	I tell you, ever since he got that Master Control Programme...
911	914	system's got more bugs than a bait store.
914	919	Gotta expect some static. After all, computers are just machines. They can't think.
919	922	Some programmes'll be thinking soon.
922	924	Won't that be grand? Computers and the programmes...
924	926	will start thinking and the people will stop.
927	928	Well, I'm gonna stay around, put some data through.
928	931	- See you tomorrow. - Bye.
931	935	- Come on. - Did you say Group 7 access?
935	938	Yeah. What a hassle.
938	941	- I was all set. - Did he say why?
941	944	It was somethin' about tamperin'.
944	946	Tampering. You know, Flynn has been thinking about...
946	949	breaking into the system ever since Dillinger canned him...
949	952	and he had Group 7 access.
952	954	Flynn had access to you too.
958	960	- I wanna go to Flynn's place. - What for?
960	963	- To warn him. - Of what?
963	965	That Dillinger's on to him.
965	969	I don't see why I have to do that guy any favours.
969	972	- I don't know what you ever saw in that guy anyway. - I loved him for his brains.
975	978	Oh, don't put any change in the metre. We're gonna need it for the games.
983	985	Boy, haven't been here in a long time.
994	996	Hey, Barbie, up here!
1007	1009	- Let's go. - Don't pull me.
1018	1020	- Where is he? - I don't know. Somewhere in here...
1020	1023	lost in one of his games.
1023	1028	- Use the buzz bomb, ya idiot. - Excuse me, champ.
1028	1032	- Uh, do you know where Flynn is? - Yeah, he's over there on his machine.
1032	1034	Hey, look. Somebody's got 300,000.
1039	1042	He's really on a roll tonight. One more Reco to go, and he ties it...
1042	1044	but then another Reco, and he gets the world's record.
1050	1053	You better watch out for this machine, man.
1053	1055	- Yes! - All right!
1057	1059	The all-time record comin' up!
1063	1065	- This is it. - It's all over.
1068	1070	All right!
1074	1076	Way to go!
1076	1079	- Hey, Flynn, how'd you do it? - It is all in the wrist.
1080	1083	999,000 points!
1086	1088	Hey, good to see you guys. Nothing classes up the joint...
1088	1090	like a clean-cut young couple.
1090	1092	We gotta talk.
1092	1094	Well, you can't even hear yourself think in here. Come on.
1097	1101	- Hey, come on, Flynn. - All right, I'll be with you- I'll be down in a minute.
1101	1104	So, how's the world of serious science, huh? Go on up.
1104	1106	Go up. Make yourselves at home. Be right up.
1110	1113	Geez. The best programmer ENCOM ever saw...
1113	1118	and he winds up playin' space cowboy in some back room.
1118	1120	Okay, let me handle this.
1120	1121	Go right ahead.
1123	1125	Have you been sneaking into the ENCOM system?
1126	1129	God. You never were much for small talk, were ya?
1132	1133	- She still leave her clothes all over the floor? - Flynn.
1134	1137	- No. Well, I-I mean not that often. - Alan!
1137	1140	Now you can see why all of his friends are 14 years old.
1140	1143	Touché. Touché.
1151	1153	I have been doing a little hacking in here, as a matter of fact.
1153	1156	- You did break in. - Tried to.
1156	1159	Can't seem to quite get the connection with that sucker though.
1159	1163	- Now if I had a direct terminal- - Flynn, are you embezzling?
1165	1169	Embezzling is such an ugly word, Mr Bradley.
1169	1171	No, actually, I'm trying to get some solid evidence together.
1171	1174	I don't get it.
1174	1180	Okay. Sherman, set the way-back machine for three years ago.
1180	1182	Kevin Flynn...
1182	1187	one of ENCOM's brightest young software engineers.
1187	1189	He's so bright, as a matter of fact, that he starts going in at night...
1189	1193	sets up his own private memory file and begins writing a programme...
1193	1197	for a video game he's invented called Space Paranoids.
1197	1202	- You invented Space Paranoids? - Paranoids. Matrix Blaster.
1202	1207	Vice Squad. A whole slew of'em. I was this close to starting my own little enterprise, man.
1207	1209	But enter another software engineer-
1209	1213	not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky.
1213	1215	Ed Dillinger.
1215	1218	So one night our boy Flynn, he's goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file.
1218	1222	I get nothin' on there. There's a big blank.
1222	1224	All right, now we take you three months later.
1224	1229	Dillinger presents ENCOM with five video games that he's invented.
1229	1233	The slime didn't even change the names, man. He gets a big, fat promotion.
1233	1238	And thus begins his meteoric rise to- What is he now? Executive V.P.?
1238	1240	Senior Exec.
1240	1244	Senior Exec?
1244	1249	Meanwhile, the kids are puttin' eight million quarters a week into Paranoid machines.
1249	1252	I don't see a dime, except what I squeeze outta here.
1252	1256	I still don't understand why you wanna break into the system.
1256	1261	Because, man, somewhere in one of these memories is the evidence.
1261	1263	If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it:
1264	1266	My password, Dillinger's instructions to divert the data.
1266	1268	- The whole shot, man. - It's too late for that. Dillinger's cut off...
1268	1270	everybody with Group 7 access.
1270	1273	Wait a- Wait, wait, wait. What are you- What are you saying now?
1274	1276	The guy knows what you're up to.
1276	1278	Oh, great. You're kidding me.
1282	1285	Well, now there is nothing to stop him.
1285	1289	Now it's just Dillinger and the MCP runnin' things from on high in there.
1289	1292	Not if my Tron programme is running.
1292	1294	That'd shut the system down.
1298	1300	- You know, if your file was in there- - Hey, wait a minute.
1300	1305	If we can get in there, I can forge us a Group 6 access.
1305	1308	Well, shall we dance?
1318	1320	I shut down Group 7 for a very good reason.
1320	1324	Ed, all I'm saying is that if our own people can't get access to their programmes-
1324	1327	Well, you know how frustrating it is when you're working on a piece of research.
1327	1330	Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming from the Master Control Programme...
1330	1333	telling me there's something screwy going on around here.
1333	1335	That MCP. That's half our problem right there.
1335	1338	The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do.
1339	1342	I can't sit here and worry about every little user request that comes in.
1342	1344	User requests are what computers are for.
1344	1346	Doing our business is what computers are for.
1364	1367	ENCOM isn't the business you started in your garage any more.
1367	1369	We're billing accounts in 30 different countries.
1369	1373	New defence systems. We have one of the most sophisticated pieces of equipment in existence.
1373	1375	Oh, I know all that.
1377	1379	Sometimes I wish I were back in that garage.
1380	1382	That can be arranged, Walter.
1384	1386	That was uncalled for.
1386	1389	You know, you can remove men like Alan and me from the system...
1389	1394	but we helped create it, and our spirit remains in every programme we designed for this computer.
1394	1396	Walter, it's getting late. I've got better things to do...
1396	1399	than to have religious discussions with you.
1399	1401	Don't worry about ENCOM any more.
1401	1403	It's out of your hands now.
1410	1413	I don't think I'm cleared for this.
1413	1416	- Well, I'm certainly not. - You wanna move aside? Give the kid a little room?
1416	1418	Will you shush?
1421	1424	This guy's a little like Santa Claus.
1424	1427	Make these myself. You want one?
1437	1439	They never should have gotten rid of me.
1443	1445	- Now that is a big door. - Shut up.
1455	1457	It's my fault. I programmed you to want too much.
1457	1460	I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week.
1460	1464	- The Pentagon? - It shouldn't be any harder than any other big company...
1464	1467	but now this is what I get for using humans.
1467	1469	Now wait a minute. I wrote you.
1469	1474	I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
1474	1476	What do you want with the Pentagon?
1476	1478	The same thing I want with the Kremlin.
1478	1482	I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access...
1482	1487	I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
1487	1489	If you think you're superior to us-
1489	1495	You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VD T at the Times, would you?
1495	1497	You wouldn't dare.
1505	1507	- Hi. - Hi.
1507	1509	- Oh, working late? - Yeah.
1515	1519	Okay, come here. I'm gonna put him at my terminal.
1519	1521	I'm gonna meet you in your office upstairs.
1521	1523	Don't fall asleep.
1523	1525	If and when I activate your Tron programme, you're only gonna have a few minutes to use it...
1525	1528	before Dillinger catches the break in security, all right?
1528	1530	- Mmm. - As long as we stay off the top floor...
1530	1533	Dillinger will never know we've been in here.
1533	1535	Good luck, hot shot.
1557	1559	Flynn!
1559	1561	After you.
1583	1585	Keep those programmers out of the system...
1585	1588	and get me that Chinese language file I asked for.
1588	1590	End of line.
1606	1608	You are gonna stay with me, aren't you?
1608	1611	What for? You're the one who never needed help, remember?
1611	1613	Hey, come on. I- I'm scared of the dark.
1613	1616	All this technology scares me. Come on, babe.
1645	1647	This way.
1653	1655	- When did they put this in? - This is where I work now.
1655	1658	I've got a direct terminal in the laser target area.
1658	1661	You can stay there all night if you have to.
1667	1669	Like the man says, there's no problems, only solutions.
1670	1672	Okay, remember: This laser is my life's work.
1673	1676	Don't spill anything, huh?
1676	1677	Have fun, sweetheart.
1693	1695	- You shouldn't have come back, Flynn. - Hey, hey, hey.
1696	1699	It's the big Master Control Programme everybody's been talkin' about.
1699	1701	Sit right back. Make yourself comfortable.
1701	1704	Remember the time we used to spend playing chess together?
1708	1711	That isn't going to do you any good, Flynn. I'm afraid-
1711	1714	Stop. Please.
1714	1717	- You realize I can't allow this. - Now how are you gonna run the universe...
1717	1720	if you can't even answer a few unsolvable problems, huh?
1720	1722	Come on, big fella. Let's see what you got.
1722	1725	I'd like to go against you and see what you're made of.
1725	1729	- You know, you don't look a thing like your pictures? - I'm warning you.
1729	1731	You're entering a big error, Flynn.
1731	1734	- I'm gonna have to put you on the game grid. - Games? You want games?
1735	1737	I'll give you games.
1828	1831	Oh, man, this isn't happening. It only thinks it's happening.
1834	1836	Vacate entry port, programme.
1841	1843	I said move!
1845	1847	Hey!
1847	1851	Look, if this is about those parking tickets, I can explain everything, okay?
1856	1858	Zero programmes with war games.
1861	1865	I've got a little challenge for you, Sark. A new recruit.
1865	1868	He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner.
1868	1872	Train him for the games, let him hope for a while and blow him away.
1873	1874	You got it.
1874	1878	I've been hoping you'd send me somebody with a little bit of guts.
1878	1883	- What kind of programme is he? - He's not any kind of programme, Sark. He's a user.
1883	1885	- A user? - That's right.
1885	1888	He pushed me in the real world.
1888	1890	Somebody pushes me, I push back...
1890	1893	so I brought him down here.
1893	1896	What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
1896	1898	Well, I-
1898	1901	It's just-
1901	1903	I don't know. A user. I mean...
1904	1906	users wrote us.
1908	1911	- A user even wrote you! - No one user wrote me.
1911	1913	I'm worth millions of their man-years.
1913	1918	- What if I can't- - You rather take your chances with me?
1918	1920	Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
1920	1922	Wait! I need that!
1922	1926	Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained.
1926	1930	I want him in the games until he dies playing. Acknowledge.
1930	1933	Acknowledged, Master Control.
1934	1936	End of line.
1940	1943	- Video game unit 18. - In here, programme.
1943	1946	Hey, who you callin' programme, programme?
1950	1952	New guy.
1952	1955	Another free programme off-line.
1955	1957	You really think the users are still there?
1957	1960	They'd better be.
1960	1963	I don't wanna bust out of here and find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
1963	1965	Hey.
1967	1970	- Who are you guys? Oh! - Hold it.
1970	1972	Wanna watch those force fields.
1972	1975	You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt. Don't worry about that.
1976	1980	Look, just so I can tell my friends...
1980	1982	what this dream is about, okay?
1982	1984	- Where am I? - You're a...
1989	1993	guest of the Master Control Programme.
1993	1997	- Oh, great. - Gonna make you play video games.
1997	2001	Okay. No sweat. I play video games better than anybody.
2006	2008	Move out. This way.
2012	2015	You. You come this way.
2015	2018	Hey, there's been a mistake. I gotta see the guy in charge.
2018	2019	You will.
2040	2044	Look, operative. Command programme Sark's carrier is approaching.
2044	2047	He will explain the training procedures.
2053	2056	Greetings.
2056	2060	The Master Control Programme has chosen you...
2060	2063	to serve your system on the game grid.
2063	2067	Those of you who continue to profess a belief in the users...
2068	2071	will receive the standard substandard training...
2071	2076	which will result in your eventual elimination.
2076	2079	Those of you who renounce...
2079	2084	this superstitious and hysterical belief...
2084	2088	will be eligible to join the warrior elite...
2088	2090	of the MCP.
2090	2093	You will each receive an identity disk.
2093	2096	Everything you do or learn...
2096	2099	will be imprinted on this disk.
2099	2104	If you lose your disk or fail to follow commands...
2104	2107	you will be subject to immediate de-resolution.
2108	2111	That will be all.
2114	2116	Move out.
2128	2131	Hey. Who's that guy?
2131	2134	- That's Tron. He fights for the users. - Tron.
2169	2172	- That's pretty good. - Watch this.
2172	2175	- You gotta be good if you wanna survive. - What's your name?
2175	2177	My name's Ram.
2181	2185	Hey, Ram. What were you, you know, before?
2185	2187	I was an actuarial programme.
2188	2191	Worked for a big insurance company.
2191	2196	Really gives you a great feeling helping folks plan for their future needs.
2196	2198	And, of course, if you think of the payments as an annuity over the years...
2198	2200	the cost is really quite minimal.
2200	2202	Yeah. That's great.
2202	2204	Actuarial programme. Nice.
2206	2208	How 'bout yourself?
2208	2213	Oh, uh, I don't remember too much. Name's Flynn.
2213	2215	Sure. A little disorientation. That's normal in transport.
2215	2218	It'll come back to you.
2220	2222	This is it. Good luck, Flynn.
2224	2228	Sir, conscript being moved from pit cell to ring game.
2228	2231	You know- Hey!
2231	2233	- You guys sure are friendly, aren't you? - Wait.
2236	2239	Let him fight one of his own kind.
2275	2277	You think you're gonna wipe me right out, don't you?
2278	2280	No, I-
2282	2285	Hey, I-I-I-
2290	2292	New guy was asking about you.
2294	2296	It's too bad he's in a match now.
2296	2299	- I'll probably never meet him. - You might.
2299	2302	There's something different about him.
2314	2316	Okay.
2338	2340	That was a very fancy shot.
2343	2346	Okay, here's an easy one.
2361	2364	- Finish the game! - No!
2364	2367	Kill him.
2367	2369	No!
2370	2372	You'll regret this.
2389	2392	I want him in the games until he dies playing.
2407	2409	This is the holding area for the Lightcycles.
2409	2411	Hey, Flynn. You made it!
2411	2414	- Wait here. - You won!
2415	2418	- Alan! - Where did you hear that name?
2418	2421	- Well, that's your name, isn't it? - The name of my user.
2424	2426	How did you know?
2426	2428	I'm a programme from a user that knows Alan.
2428	2430	He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
2430	2433	Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff.
2433	2436	Like my user wants me to go after the MCP.
2436	2440	- My user wants that too. - I know.
2452	2456	Prepare to transport to Lightcycle grid.
2457	2461	- We have transport. - Wow.
2472	2475	This is blue leader to blue bikes. Run these guys into your jet walls.
2475	2477	- Copy, blue leader. - Copy, blue leader.
2477	2479	This is gold one to gold two and three. Split up.
2479	2483	Take 'em one on one.
2511	2513	Watch it! Watch it!
2531	2533	I'm takin' him into the maze.
2544	2546	This is it. Come on.
2556	2560	Gold three to gold two and one. I'm gettin' out of here right now, and you guys are invited.
2560	2561	Got it.
2563	2565	- Ready? - Ready.
2565	2567	So long, sucker.
2583	2585	Greetings, programmes.
2587	2590	Video game warriors escaping game grid.
2590	2593	This is an illegal exit. You must return to game grid.
2593	2596	Repeat: This is an illegal exit.
2596	2598	- You must return to the grid. - Gold two to gold three.
2598	2600	Those demons are comin' down.
2611	2613	Get them.
2613	2616	Send out every game tank in the grid.
2616	2619	Get them!
2619	2622	I should never have written all those tank programmes.
2635	2637	Targets leaving protective field.
2641	2643	Missed!
2648	2650	All units exiting game arena!
2668	2670	Target units accelerating!
2684	2687	Pursuit force minus one tank. Close ranks.
2710	2712	Oh, man.
2715	2718	On the other side of the screen, it all looked so easy.
2724	2727	They must've gone right past us.
2728	2734	We made it... this far.
2738	2741	Pursuit force reporting. We lost visual contact with escaped units.
2741	2744	- Awaiting further orders. - Get the pursuit forces back into the canyons.
2744	2746	Those programmes never made it out of there.
2746	2749	We'll have them back in no time, sir, long before the interrupt interface.
2749	2751	We'd better, Null Unit.
2751	2755	I'll be lucky if the MCP doesn't blast me into a dead zone.
2755	2758	I want those conscripts!
2766	2769	What is it? What do you see?
2769	2770	Watch it. Watch it.
2775	2777	Come on, you little bugger. Come on.
2778	2780	Look at that.
2780	2783	When do we pay our visit to the old, uh, Master Control, huh?
2783	2785	What?
2786	2790	There's just three of us.
2790	2792	Well, you know anybody who's got an army for rent, that's fine...
2792	2796	but my, uh, user told me to go take that sucker out...
2796	2798	or I'm never gettin' outta here.
2798	2802	We can't get to the MCP without the help of my user.
2804	2806	I have to get to that input/ output tower...
2806	2808	and communicate with him.
2811	2813	Well, good. Check in with Alan. Maybe he knows what's-
2813	2815	What's that?
2816	2821	That is just what I need right now.
2837	2840	Oh, thank you. Ohh!
2847	2848	Incredible.
2855	2860	Oh! Boy, you forget how good the power feels...
2860	2862	until you get to a pure source.
2864	2868	My friends, my fellow conscripts, we have scored.
2868	2870	I feel so much better.
2875	2877	Pursuit force reporting. No sign of escaped units.
2877	2879	Moving into next sector.
2883	2886	- Mmm. Thank you. - I can feel it.
2888	2890	Feel what? You okay?
2892	2896	Alan One.
2896	2898	Let's move out!
2908	2911	- Come on, Flynn. Put a cork in it. - One second.
2942	2947	Range: 9. Mark: 45. 48 degrees.
2953	2955	Hold it. Hold it.
2955	2958	Fire!
2968	2971	- Ram! Flynn! Do you read me? - Pursuit force reporting.
2971	2973	Two escaped units de-rezzed.
2973	2975	No!
2986	2988	Tron unit heading into next sector.
2994	2997	Ram. Ram!
3000	3003	Come on! We gotta get outta here.
3006	3009	No sign of life. Looks like we got 'em.
3017	3019	Continue pursuit of remaining conscript.
3019	3022	Acknowledged. Proceeding toward sector frontier.
3026	3029	We're gonna make it, Ram. I just gotta find you a place to rest.
3045	3047	Hang in there, Ram.
3047	3049	Ah, this looks like a good spot.
3057	3060	Those tanks won't find us here.
3060	3063	- Ohhh. - Okay.
3066	3068	I thought this was supposed to be easy.
3100	3103	Hey, what's goin' on?
3109	3111	You see this?
3111	3113	You shouldn't be able to do that.
3122	3125	Now for some real user power.
3154	3157	Hey, this looks promising.
3162	3164	This is just like the old arcade grips.
3168	3171	All right, let's get this show on the road.
3179	3181	Now we're smokin'.
3181	3183	How can you steal a Recognizer?
3183	3185	Hey, you okay? You don't look so good.
3185	3188	We'll get you fixed up. Hang on.
3188	3190	Come here.
3211	3216	Oh, my user. Users are users. They-
3221	3224	Are you a user?
3224	3227	Yeah.
3237	3238	Flynn?
3240	3242	Help Tron.
3252	3255	Ram.
3262	3264	Ram!
3306	3308	Damn Recognizer.
3310	3312	Why won't you just go straight?
3313	3316	I gotta get to that I/ O tower.
3316	3320	Programme ALOU. Request additional information for sector two.
3321	3323	Prepare hangar for game simulation transport.
3324	3327	Attention, all units. Lock onto matrix code.
3327	3330	Prepare for digital beam transport.
3330	3331	Activate hangar doors.
3334	3336	What's the progress on the simulation?
3336	3340	30-56. 99 are correct.
3340	3343	Limited 4 and 8 are missing.
3348	3350	Don't scream.
3350	3352	Yori.
3352	3354	30-56. 99 are correct.
3354	3358	- Limited 4 and 8 are missing. - No, I-
3361	3364	Tron. Oh!
3366	3368	Yori.
3369	3372	I knew you'd escape.
3372	3374	They haven't built a circuit that could hold you.
3374	3377	Listen, Yori. We have to make plans.
3377	3379	Where can we go?
3384	3387	This way. Quickly.
3395	3397	Hey!
3398	3401	Hold it right there!
3401	3404	- Yes. - What do you mean "yes"?
3404	3406	- Yes. - Is that all you can say?
3410	3412	- No. - Oh. Anything else?
3412	3415	Yes.
3415	3418	Positive and negative, huh? You're a bit.
3418	3421	Yes.
3421	3423	Well, where's your programme? Isn't he gonna miss ya?
3423	3427	- No. - I'm your programme?
3427	3430	- Yes. - Ah, another mouth to feed.
3430	3432	Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
3442	3444	Watch out for nested macros.
3446	3449	- Who are all these weirdos? - Inoperative data pushers.
3449	3451	- Control programmes. Come on. - These tendencies must be discouraged.
3454	3457	Pretty good drivin', huh?
3459	3462	- No. - Who asked you?
3477	3480	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3496	3498	This baby doesn't handle so good in town.
3498	3501	No.
3504	3506	- What's this do? How 'bout this one? - No. No, no.
3508	3511	Here comes a headache.
3513	3515	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3518	3521	- Ah! We gotta stop this thing! - Yes.
3521	3524	I'm glad you agree!
3545	3548	- Uh, I'm fine. No problem. - I hope they hurry.
3548	3551	My next assignment is in quadrant four.
3551	3554	Oh, this town is full of live ones.
3556	3558	Hey.
3565	3568	This is where Tron said he was goin'.
3570	3573	Losing Flynn.
3602	3604	I don't believe this.
3616	3618	Halt!
3624	3627	More guards.
3679	3683	They don't see us. I'll go first.
3704	3706	- Are you all right? - Yeah. Let's do that some more.
3707	3710	Yeah. I think the guard saw me.
3710	3712	Come on.
3720	3721	- Halt. - Dumont.
3721	3724	I can't stand all this commotion. What do you want?
3724	3726	I've come to communicate with my user.
3726	3730	Difficult proposition. Difficult proposition at best.
3731	3734	Why, I could be de-rezzed just for letting you in here.
3734	3736	They hate this tower.
3736	3739	They'd close it down if they dared.
3739	3741	They keep me around just in case one of them...
3741	3744	wants to deal with the other world once in a while.
3744	3748	Dumont!
3748	3753	My user has information that could, well, could make this a free system again.
3754	3756	No, really. Why, you'd have programmes lined up...
3756	3758	just to use this place...
3758	3761	and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
3761	3763	When you've been in the system as long as I have...
3763	3768	you hear many promises, many reassurances, many brave plans.
3768	3771	Please, Dumont. The guards are coming.
3773	3775	There they are, with the Guardian.
3775	3777	All right, Yori. All right.
3780	3784	Who is your user, programme?
3784	3788	Alan One. He calls me. May I pass?
3789	3793	All that is visible must grow beyond itself...
3793	3797	and extend into the realm of the invisible.
3797	3799	You may pass, my friend.
3808	3811	The tower Guardian is helping him.
3811	3813	He thinks.
3813	3816	Bring in the logic probe!
3832	3835	More power!
3892	3894	It's begun.
3896	3899	Tron, location query. Confirm.
3899	3902	- Confirmed, Alan One. - I am creating the information on your disk...
3902	3906	that will erase the MCP and change the system.
3906	3910	Dedicate yourself to getting the disk into the heart of the MCP.
3910	3912	This interface is located at its base.
3912	3915	We will not be able to communicate again...
3915	3916	unless you succeed.
3917	3918	Go.
3928	3931	This is the key to a new order.
3931	3934	This code disk means freedom.
3936	3939	I think they're breaking in.
3947	3949	- Thank you, Dumont. - Hurry. The users are waiting.
3964	3967	Dumont!
3970	3972	Where's the programme?
3972	3974	What programme?
3976	3978	Take him!
3987	3989	Stay close.
3998	4002	If I can just get us on the scanning transport beam-
4002	4006	This solar sailor simulation will take us across the game sea, out of this domain...
4006	4008	back into the central computer.
4015	4017	Look out!
4094	4099	Commander, you've enjoyed all the power you've been given, haven't you?
4099	4102	I wonder how you'd take to working in a pocket calculator.
4102	4105	We did take care of that user you sent us.
4105	4108	You incompetent zero. Now you've got two renegade programmes...
4108	4110	flying all over the system in a stolen simulation.
4110	4114	We'll get them. It's only a matter of time.
4114	4118	You've almost reached your decision gate, and I can't spare you any more time.
4118	4120	End of line.
4128	4130	Hey, it's me! Flynn!
4130	4132	- Flynn! - Yeah. Greetings, programme.
4132	4134	Flynn, you're alive.
4134	4137	Barely.
4137	4140	Yeah, I, uh-
4153	4155	Where's Ram?
4155	4158	He didn't make it.
4165	4167	Well, come on.
4180	4182	Lora.
4182	4185	This is Flynn, the one who busted me out.
4185	4189	- Lora? - Well, then, I owe him some thanks.
4191	4194	No, it's, uh, no big deal.
4194	4197	I oughta know my way around a Lightcycle routine. I wrote the programme for it.
4197	4200	- You wrote the programme? - It's time I level with you.
4200	4203	I'm what you guys call a user.
4203	4206	- You're a user? - I took a wrong turn somewhere.
4206	4209	If you are a user...
4209	4212	then everything you've done has been according to a plan, right?
4212	4214	You wish.
4215	4217	Well, you guys know what it's like. You just keep doin' what it looks like...
4217	4220	you're supposed to be doin', no matter how crazy it seems.
4220	4222	Well, that's the way it is for programmes, yes.
4222	4224	I hate to disappoint you, pal, but most of the time...
4224	4227	that's the way it is for users too.
4227	4229	Stranger and stranger.
4229	4232	So, nice-lookin' ship you got here.
4251	4254	Sir, what do you want done with the tower Guardian, Dumont?
4254	4256	Put him with the others?
4256	4258	No, bit brain. Prepare him for inquisition.
4259	4262	I need a little bit of relaxation. But first, rez up the carrier for pursuit.
4262	4265	One other thing: Don't think any more.
4265	4267	I do the thinking around here.
4274	4277	This isn't gonna be easy. If those grid bugs get us, we've had it.
4300	4304	- Had enough? - What do you want? I'm busy.
4304	4307	Busy dying, you worn-out excuse for an old programme?
4307	4310	Yes, I'm old-
4310	4313	old enough to remember the MCP when it was just a chess programme.
4313	4316	He started small, and he'll end small.
4316	4320	Very funny, Dumont. Maybe I should keep you around just to make me laugh.
4330	4333	- What's happening? - Power surge from the MCP.
4333	4335	- We have to get off this beam. - I can't.
4335	4338	There isn't another junction for seven or eight nanoseconds.
4338	4341	- There's another beam! - It's too far.
4359	4362	He's creating a junction.
4383	4385	Did we make it?
4385	4388	- Yeah. - Hooray for our side.
4413	4415	- Is he de-rezzing? - No.
4415	4417	But I couldn't tell you why not.
4421	4423	I'm all in one piece.
4423	4425	I guess I'm still with ya.
4428	4430	Tell the guy with the jackhammer to lay off, will ya?
4430	4432	How did you do that?
4432	4435	Elementary physics: a beam of energy can always be diverted.
4435	4437	Are we there yet, Mommy?
4489	4491	Sark!
4505	4507	- Dumont! - Yori!
4509	4511	Tron?
4513	4514	Tron's dead.
4517	4520	- Who's that? - That is a user, Dumont.
4522	4525	He came here to help us.
4525	4527	Tron believed in him.
4528	4531	If the users can no longer help us, we're lost.
4531	4534	So, we have erased that programme-
4534	4537	No. You were de-rezzed. I saw you.
4537	4540	- Not me, Sark. - There's nothing special about you.
4540	4543	- You're just an ordinary programme. - So are you.
4543	4545	- One that should've been erased. - You're nothing!
4547	4549	Take that programme to the holding pit!
4558	4560	Please, don't take him-
4561	4565	We're taking our friend here and some other religious fanatics...
4565	4567	to Master Control.
4567	4570	When I disembark, this ship...
4570	4574	and everything that remains on board will automatically de-rez.
4577	4579	This means you.
4585	4587	Move out!
4614	4618	- Intermediate vectors detached. - Route us to the MCP.
4618	4622	I want to get rid of this dead weight and catch a transport beam to the game domain.
4631	4636	These walls. Yori. Something's happening.
4694	4698	Hey.
4698	4700	Yori?
4700	4704	I still have power. Sark doesn't know that.
4704	4707	- Leave me alone. We've failed. - We're only gonna fail if we give up!
4707	4709	Now come on! Look! The wall!
4711	4713	Yori.
4721	4725	You brought me back. How?
4725	4727	Why did you bring me back?
4727	4729	I need your help. Come on.
4758	4760	Do something with these controls!
4760	4763	- I'm on it. - It's the MCP.
4763	4765	It's the heart of the whole system.
4787	4790	I feel a presence. Another warrior is on the mesa.
4794	4796	Sark!
4798	4801	We're getting closer.
4804	4808	I don't know how you survived, slave.
4808	4811	It doesn't matter. Prepare to terminate.
4824	4827	All programmes have a desire to be useful...
4827	4831	but in moments, you will no longer seek communication with each other...
4831	4833	or your superfluous users.
4833	4837	You will each be part of me, and together, we will be complete.
4844	4847	You should've joined me. We'd have made a great team.
4851	4854	- You're very persistent, Tron. - I'm also better than you.
4868	4870	Sark!
4870	4873	All my functions are now yours.
4873	4875	Take 'em.
4877	4879	Sark.
4882	4884	Sark.
4889	4891	Look at that.
4906	4909	Your user can't help you now, my little programme.
4919	4923	I got it. Steer us over by the beam.
4923	4925	- Right next to it. - What good'll that do?
4927	4928	I'm gonna jump.
4930	4934	- It's the only way to help Tron. - Don't. You'll be de-rezzed.
4952	4954	Don't worry.
5018	5021	Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
5063	5064	We did it!
5073	5076	- That's nice. - We thought you were dead.
5078	5081	- Where's Flynn? - It was incredible. He threw himself into the beam and...
5081	5085	distracted the MCP just long enough for you to get the disk in.
5086	5088	He saved us. He really did it.
5088	5091	Video warriors, look at the I/ O tower.
5093	5096	Every tower is lighting up.
5147	5149	Priority one!
5157	5159	Hey!
5204	5207	Try to look official. Here comes the boss.
5223	5225	Pick me up in an hour. Thanks.
