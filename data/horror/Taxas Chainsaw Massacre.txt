379	380	Franklin!
391	393	Are you ok?
397	402	This heat is just driving me crazy. I don't know if I can take...
403	406	- much more of this. - The condition of retro gradation...
406	409	is contrary or inharmonious to the regular direction of actual...
410	412	movement in the zodiac, and is, in that respect, evil.
413	416	Hint: When malefic planets are in retrograde, and Saturn is malefic...
416	419	their maleficies are increased.
420	422	Have you been doing that Reader's Digest worth our...
423	425	Jerry, it just means Saturn's a bad influence. It's just particularly...
425	428	bad influence now, because it's in retrograde.
429	432	Hey, man, do you believe all that stuff your old lady is talking me?
451	454	My granddaddy is buried here. Can we find out if anything happened?
454	456	- What's your granddaddy's name? - See that big heavy fella...
456	460	standing with that big flashlight, isn't that the sheriff?
460	463	You go tell him your granddaddy is buried in there. He'll let you in.
463	466	Ok. Thank you.
466	467	Hey, fella, I'm gonna run off to...
468	469	- meet him if you don't mind, do you? - Not at all.
471	473	- Hey, folks. Let us go see where...
474	476	her granddaddy's buried.
480	483	Things happen here about they don't tell about.
484	488	I see things.
490	495	You see, they say it's just an old man talking.
497	500	You laugh at an old man...
501	506	this thing that laughs knows better.
512	516	Yes, they're sure. The man said the Tallman's grave had been dug up.
517	520	Mama, don't worry. I saw it myself!
520	522	It didn't look dug up to me.
526	528	What's that? What smell?
529	534	What is that stench?
539	543	Hey. That's the old slaughterhouse. That's where Grandpa used...
545	548	to sell his cattle! We got an uncle that works in one of those places...
549	552	outside of Fortworth. See those buildings there? That's where...
552	556	they kill him. They bash'em in the head with a big sledgehammer!
556	558	- That's awful. - It usually wouldn't kill him.
574	577	It'd start squealing and freaking out, they'd have to...
577	579	come up and bash'em 2 or 3 times.
579	583	They'd scatter them before they were even dead.
584	586	That's horrible! People shouldn't kill animals for food.
587	590	They don't do it like that anymore. Now they get this big air gun...
591	593	that shoots a bullet into the skull and then retracts it.
596	599	Franklin, I like me, please change the subject.
600	601	That smell's still going on.
605	607	Oh, man! It's hot in here.
613	616	- Hitchhiker! - Should we take him up?
616	618	Yeah man, pick him up. He'll asphyxiate out there!
619	620	- What does he look like? - The son of a bitch 's gonna...
620	623	- smell like the slaughterhouse. - Give the guy a break. He can...
623	625	- sit by Franklin. - What do you wanna do?
626	628	- He's weird looking, no.
648	652	- I think we just picked up Dracula. - Where're you heading, man?
653	657	- You work at that place? - Don't.
658	660	- How did you get stuck out here?
661	664	- I was at the slaughterhouse. - I got an uncle that works...
664	666	- at a slaughterhouse. - My brother worked there.
667	668	My grandfather, too.
669	672	My family's always been in beef.
673	675	The whole family are cracked. Hey man, did you go into that...
676	680	slaughter room or whatever they call it?
680	682	Where they shoot the cattle with that air gun thing?
683	686	- That gun is no good. - I was in there once with my uncle.
686	689	With the sledge! That was better.
690	693	- They died better that way. - How come? I thought the gun...
693	695	- was better. - Oh no. With the new way...
695	700	- people were put out of jobs.
701	703	- You do that? - Look!
709	713	- I was the killer! - Let me see them.
713	716	- They don't seem to head your way. - You took these, huh?
717	719	- Yeah! - Franklin.
721	722	- Let me see. - They make hitches...
723	732	They take the head and they boil, except for the tongue, and scrape...
733	736	all the flesh away from the bone.
737	739	They use everything, they throw nothing away.
740	745	They use jaws, muscles, and the eyes, and the ligaments...
745	747	- and everything! - Look at this.
748	752	- They boil the nose and the gums down to a big jelly of fat.
753	754	I don't know it was in that stuff.
755	757	It's really good. Do you like it?
758	763	- Yeah, I like it. It's good! - It sounds horrible. Can't we...
763	766	- talk about something else? - You'd probably like it if you...
766	768	didn't know what was in it.
768	770	I wouldn't and I wish you'd stop talking about it.
772	774	Take it before everybody's sick.
791	793	What are you doing?
795	798	Look. I think that might hurt.
806	808	Oh, come on!
809	811	What are you doing to yourself?
813	815	Oh, what are you doing?
824	826	Nice, man!
846	849	I have this knife.
851	852	Put that away, too.
854	858	- It's a good knife. - I'm sure it is, man. Put it back.
901	903	You took my picture!
904	908	You can take me to my house. I live right off this road.
909	912	I don't know, man. We're in much of a hurry.
914	917	- How close is it? - It's real close.
917	921	Couldn't you just walk? I mean... If it's so close.
922	925	You could have dinner with us. You like head cheese. My brother...
926	928	- makes it real good. You'll like it. - I think we'd better push on, man.
929	934	Don't we, Jerry? Yeah, I'm sorry...
956	961	- It didn't turn out so good. - It's a nice picture.
962	963	- You can pay me now. - Huh?
964	966	- 2 dollars. It's a good picture. - No, man. Franklin...
967	969	give him back that picture.
1063	1065	I'm about to freak. Call a cop.
1066	1068	That's the last damn hitchhiker I ever take.
1075	1077	- Listen to Franklin's horoscope: - I'm sorry.
1081	1082	Travel in the countryside.
1083	1086	Long range plans, upsetting persons...
1087	1090	around you, could make this a disturbing and unpredictable day.
1091	1095	The events in the world are not doing much, to cheer one up.
1095	1097	- That's just perfect! - Franklin, I think you'll be alright.
1098	1102	Hey, Kat, read Alex's. He's Capricorn.
1111	1112	Oh, no.
1112	1117	Capricorn is ruled by Saturn. There are moments where we...
1117	1119	cannot believe that what's happening is really true...
1120	1123	pinch yourself and you may find out that it is.
1155	1157	Hurry up.
1165	1167	Here comes somebody.
1173	1174	How are you?
1177	1178	Would you fill her up, please?
1180	1182	I got no gas.
1183	1186	- You're out of gas? - My tank's empty. Transport won't...
1186	1189	be here until this afternoon.
1189	1192	Maybe not even until tomorrow morning.
1192	1195	Hey, you know where "The Old Franklin Place" is?
1201	1204	- "The Old Franklin Place"? - It's an old 2-story house and...
1204	1207	it's sitting up on the hill. I think you have to turn on the road...
1208	1210	back there, but I'm not real sure.
1211	1214	Maybe I've seen something like that up there. But look, you boys...
1216	1220	don't wanna go messing around an old house.
1221	1224	Those things are dangerous, you're bound to get hurt!
1224	1227	- We'll be careful. - Don't wanna go fooling around...
1227	1231	other folk's property. Some folks don't like it.
1231	1233	They don't mind showing you.
1233	1236	- My father owns it. - That's your daddy's place, huh?
1236	1238	- Yeah. - Look...
1239	1243	I got barbecue here. Why don't you stay a while?
1243	1246	The transport will be by in a little while...
1249	1251	I can go and get some barbecue.
1253	1256	Them girls, they don't wanna go messing around an old house.
1257	1258	Best you stick around here.
1270	1273	We should've asked him if there's another gas station around here.
1273	1275	Don't you think he would have told us if there was?
1277	1281	- It wouldn't hurt to ask. - I'll go ask.
1286	1288	What the hell, we should have stopped back there for gas.
1289	1292	Go, damn it. There.
1293	1294	You think this place has room service?
1296	1298	Franklin, you're cutting the van!
1301	1304	Yeah, I just started doing that.
1308	1314	I bet this is some of that guy's blood. Look at that.
1314	1317	- Think it's his blood? - I guess so.
1320	1323	That's blood, alright. And I got cut the hell out of him, chef.
1325	1327	You think you could do that to yourself?
1328	1331	Crazy?
1332	1336	It takes something, though, I mean, do that to yourself, like he did.
1340	1343	You think I said something that made him mad?
1346	1349	- What? - Franklin, you're crazy as he was.
1352	1356	Hey, I got us some barbecue. Newt's the closest place to get gas.
1363	1367	We're going to that Granpa's place. There's a creek, you can go swimming.
1367	1370	Come on, Sally, we're going to that Granpa's place!
1371	1374	- Let's go. - Hey, that guy smeared blood...
1375	1379	- all over the van. - Let's not waste time to wipe this up.
1380	1383	What? What did you do? You're in someone's van?
1405	1406	Let me see your knife.
1411	1412	Thank you.
1418	1421	Franklin, if we run out of gas before we get back to that service...
1421	1423	station, you're towing us back in that chair.
1434	1435	Hey...
1436	1438	You think that guy was just trying to scare us by blowing out...
1439	1440	my picture like that?
1488	1490	Oh, look, they let the place fall apart.
1493	1495	Put it over there.
1496	1498	- Wanna go over there? - Let's go.
1504	1505	Oh, Kirk, come on!
1506	1507	What's wrong? What's wrong?
1512	1514	I want to see the smear the guy made.
1522	1526	This is weird. I wonder if that means something.
1526	1528	It's the mark of Zorro. He's gonna get you.
1528	1532	- Why don't you wash it off, ok? - I want to see inside.
1533	1535	- Jerry! - Ok!
1537	1539	Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
1541	1544	- Get it. You wash it up. - You don't think that guy...
1544	1547	- is trying to follow us, do you? - What for?
1560	1562	Where's my knife? Kirk?
1565	1567	Looks like it must have been a nursery room.
1567	1571	This was my room. I got to stay here until I was 8 years old.
1571	1573	- Until my grandmother died. - What happened?
1574	1577	- To my grandmother? - Yeah, she died.
1612	1614	- What do you think of the wallpaper? - I think it's seen better days...
1615	1618	These animals would to put me to sleep when I was a little girl.
1618	1621	Look at the zebra. I had this fascination for the zebras...
1622	1624	Kate?
1651	1652	Sally!
1721	1723	Come on, Franklin! It's gonna be a fun trip.
1732	1736	If I have any more fun today, I don't think I'll take it!
1756	1759	- Hey, Franklin! - What's wrong?
1760	1763	Didn't you say there was a swimming well out here?
1765	1767	Pam and I would like to go swimming in there.
1771	1774	There used to be a trail down between those two old sheds.
1775	1776	Come on.
1779	1783	- Are Jerry and Sally going? - We'll see them in an hour or so.
1786	1789	Yeah. See them down in about an hour or so.
1810	1814	Sally! Sally...
1832	1834	Seed growing in the world...
1835	1837	I don't want to miss it.
1841	1843	Man, a scorpion, there's a scorpion!
1856	1857	Crap!
1861	1862	This must be it!
1863	1865	Are you ok?
1867	1869	What the hell, Franklin would never get down here anyway.
1870	1872	I bet he must have when he was little.
1873	1875	Franklin never was little.
1885	1886	Gasoline.
1887	1890	I can leave my guitar, you know, I'd give him a couple of bucks...
1891	1894	We gotta come back by here anyway, I can pick up my guitar and...
1894	1896	give him a couple more dollars and we get more gas...
1896	1899	He won't want your guitar, he's not gonna sell us some gas...
1899	1901	let's just go back now.
1943	1947	Hey, come here! Come here, look at this.
1973	1974	- A generator! - What?
1976	1978	A generator! For electricity!
1981	1984	Hey, hello! Is there anybody in the house?
2029	2030	Hello! Is anybody home?
2052	2054	I got something for you.
2062	2063	Let's go!
2067	2068	Hello?
2070	2072	Hello?
2082	2084	- Come look at this! - Let's go!
2088	2089	Hello!
2093	2094	Anybody home?
2097	2097	Hello?
2109	2110	Hey, Pam!
2118	2119	Hello!
2143	2144	Kirk!
2158	2160	Kirk!
2169	2169	Kirk!
2179	2180	Kirk?
2204	2205	Kirk!
2209	2210	Kirk?
2220	2220	Kirk?
2427	2429	He's gonna get you, Franklin. He's coming to get you!
2430	2431	You don't think it means anything?
2432	2434	We'll protect you if he tries to get you.
2434	2437	- Maybe it's about me. - He's gonna kill you, Franklin.
2440	2443	- It probably doesn't mean anything. - You worry too much.
2445	2449	He couldn't find us, anyway. He doesn't even know our names.
2449	2452	I gave him your name, Franklin. And I told him where you lived.
2452	2455	I even gave him your ZIP code. He's gonna kill you.
2455	2456	Jerry...
2457	2460	- What are you doing? - I can't find my knife.
2461	2463	That knife won't do you any good. He likes that knife, remember?
2464	2465	When did you have it last?
2467	2471	I didn't have it last. You had it last.
2471	2474	I gave it to you, remember? What did you do with it?
2474	2475	I don't know. Didn't I give it back to you?
2476	2479	No, I didn't have it when I got out of the van.
2479	2482	- You just never gave it back to me. - All right. I'll look for it.
2484	2487	Listen, I think I'll walk down to the creek before it gets too dark.
2487	2488	How do I get there, Frank?
2489	2491	Well, there's a trail down there. Between the two old sheds.
2493	2496	- Can I go too? - I think you'd better stay here.
2498	2499	All right.
2507	2509	I can't find it.
2517	2521	- Are you mad at me? - No, I'm not mad at you.
2525	2527	You really are mad, huh?
2528	2531	I don't blame you.
2532	2534	Kirk!
2544	2547	You really didn't want me to come, did you?
2548	2553	Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired. It's been a long day.
2557	2562	Did you believe all that stuff Pam was telling about?
2562	2564	Saturn, and retrograde, and all that?
2565	2569	I don't know. Everything means something, I guess.
2575	2577	You don't think that guy is trying to follow us, do you?
2578	2580	I mean, there's no way that he could follow us.
2585	2587	He'd probably find Kirk and kill him.
2595	2597	- Sally... - What now?
2601	2603	Nothing.
2606	2608	Nevermind.
2613	2614	Kirk!
2644	2646	Hello?
2650	2651	Is anybody home?
2656	2659	Excuse me, I'm looking for some friends. Hello?
2665	2667	Is anybody here?
2671	2672	Damn.
2689	2692	Kirk! Are you guys in there?
2697	2700	Hey, guys! Quit playing games. Quit goofing on me.
2709	2711	Pam, is that you?
2715	2717	Okay, you guys!
2721	2724	Come on out. Come on!
2735	2737	Kirk?
2856	2860	They must be lost. They don't have a flashlight or anything.
2860	2862	If they 're not back in a minute, we'd better go look for them
2863	2866	What if we get lost, too?
2867	2870	Sally, we ought to go to that gas station and get help.
2871	2873	I'm not leaving here without Jerry.
2875	2877	Jerry!
2878	2883	- Jerry! - Jerry!
2885	2888	Jerry!
2889	2890	Jerry!
2892	2893	Hey!
2898	2900	They'll probably be back in a minute or so.
2902	2905	Sally, we ought to go to that gas station.
2908	2909	Sally...
2911	2913	I think we ought to go.
2917	2919	Are the keys in the van?
2921	2924	Could I see the flashlight for a minute?
2924	2925	What for?
2926	2928	Let me see the flashlight. I'm gonna go look for them.
