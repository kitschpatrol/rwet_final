680	683	I stopped by your house. Your mom told me you left, like, at 6:00 or something.

720	722	- You're trusting. - Why do you say that ?
722	726	How do you know they're taking the right amount of change or even paying for what they take ?

928	931	Bye. Take it easy.
932	935	- [ Ronni ] That was Snowball. - Why do you call him that ?
935	939	Silvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
939	941	What do you mean ?
941	945	After the blow job, he likes to have it spit back into his mouth while kissing.
945	947	It's called snowballing.
947	949	- He requests this ? - He gets off on it.
950	953	- Silvan can be talked into anything. - Why do you say that ?
953	955	Like you said, she snowballed him.
955	959	- Silvan ? No, l snowballed him. - Yeah, right.
960	962	I'm serious.
962	965	- You sucked that guy's dick ? - Yeah. How do you think l knew--
965	969	You said you only had sex with three different guys ! You never mentioned him !
969	972	- Because l never had sex with him. - You sucked his dick !
972	975	We went out a few times. We never had sex, but we fooled around.
975	978	Oh, my God. Why did you tell me you only had sex with three guys ?
978	981	Because l did only have sex with three guys.
981	984	- it doesn't mean I didn't just go with people. - Oh, my God, l feel so nauseous !
984	986	I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.

995	998	Shut up a second and I'll tell you. Jesus !

1001	1003	This is different. This is important. How many ?
1014	1016	Well ?
1017	1022	- Something like 36. - What ? Something like 36 ?
1022	1025	- Lower your voice. - What is that-- ""Something like 36"" ?
1025	1026	Does that include me ?
1028	1030	- Uh... 37. - I'm 37 ?
1030	1034	- I'm going to class. - Oh, my God.
1034	1038	- 37 ! My girlfriend sucked 37 dicks! - in a row ?
1038	1041	- Where you going ? - Hey, listen, jerk. Until today, you never even knew...
1041	1044	how many guys l slept with because you never even bothered to ask.
1044	1048	Then you act all nonchalant about fucking 12 girls. I never had sex with 12 guys !
1048	1051	- No, but you sucked enough dick ! - Yeah, l went down on a few guys.
1051	1054	- A few ? - One of those guys was you. The last one, l might add.
1054	1058	Which, if you're too stupid to comprehend, means that I've been faithful to you since we met.
1058	1062	All the other guys I went with before l met you. If you want to have a complex, go ahead.
1062	1065	But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy before you met me.
1065	1069	Why did you suck their dick ? Why couldn't you sleep with them Like any other decent person ?
1069	1071	Because going down isn't a big deal.
1071	1074	I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him.
1074	1077	- But l only had sex with the guys l loved. - l feel sick.
1077	1079	I love you ! Don't feel sick.
1079	1082	Every time l kiss you, I'm gonna taste 36 other guys.
1082	1085	- I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational. - I'm 37 ! l just can't--
1085	1087	Good-bye, Dante !
1090	1093	Hey, try not to suck any dick on the way through the parking lot !
1093	1096	Hey ! Hey, you ! Get back here.

1109	1113	Hey, it's not like it's a demanding job over there.
1113	1116	I'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV.
1116	1119	I walked in the other day, that son of a bitch was sleeping.
1119	1121	- I'm sure he wasn't sleeping. - Are you calling me a liar ?
1122	1125	- Are you calling me a liar ? - No ! He was probably just resting his eyes.
1125	1128	What the hell is that, ""resting his eyes"" ?
1128	1132	- Like he's some air traffic controller? - Actually, that's his night job.
1132	1135	Wise ass too, huh ? Go ahead. Keep cracking wise.
1135	1139	That's why you're jockeying a register in some fuckin' convenience store...
1139	1141	instead of working at a steady job.
1141	1145	I've got no time to bullshit around, waiting for that son of a bitch.
1145	1147	Make sure he gets that.
1147	1151	The number's 812. My name's Wynarski. I wanted a movie tonight.
1151	1154	If you tell me the title of the movie, he'll hold it for you.

1290	1294	- [ Randal ] Want something to drink ? I'm buying. - [ Dante ] No, thanks.
1294	1296	Who was on your phone this morning, like, 2:30 ?
1296	1299	- l was trying to call for half an hour. - Why ?
1299	1302	I wanted to use your car. Snack cake.
1302	1304	You don't wanna know.
1304	1306	- You call Caitlin again ? - She called me.
1306	1310	- You tell Veronica ? - One fight a day with Veronica is all l can stomach, thanks.
1310	1313	- What do you fight about ? - We don't fight about anything.
1313	1316	She wants me to leave here and go back to school and get some direction.
1316	1319	- l bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree. - You win.
1319	1322	I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend. Let the past be the past.
1322	1325	Forget Caitlin Bree. You been with Veronica how long now ?
1325	1327	- Seven months. - Chick's nuts about you.
1327	1329	- How long you date Caitlin ? - Five years.
1329	1332	Chick only made you nuts, man. She cheated on you how many times ?
1332	1334	- Eight and a half. - Eight and a half ?
1334	1337	Party at John Kay's, senior year; I get blitzed, pass out in his bedroom.
1337	1340	-Caitlin comes in and jumps all over me. -So that's cheating ?
1340	1343	- No. In the middle of it she called me Brad. - She called you Brad ?
1344	1346	That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex.
1347	1349	- One time, l called this girl ""mom."" - l hit the light, she freaks.
1350	1352	- She thought l was Brad Michelson. - What do you mean ?
1352	1355	She was supposed to meet Brad in a dark bedroom. She picked the wrong one.
1355	1357	- She didn't even know I was at the party. - Oh, my God.
1357	1360	- Great story, huh ? - That girl was vile to you.
1360	1363	Interesting postscript to that story. Do you know who wound up in that bedroom with Brad ?
1363	1365	- Your mother ? - Alan Harris.
1365	1368	- Chess team Alan Harris ? - The two moved to Idaho together.
1368	1369	They raise sheep.
1370	1372	- That's frightening. - Takes different strokes to move the world.
1372	1374	In light of this lurid tale, I don't see...
1374	1376	how you could romanticize your relationship with Caitlin.
1376	1379	She broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
1379	1381	There was a lot of good in our relationship.
1381	1383	Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.
1383	1387	That's what high school was about: algebra, bad lunch and infidelity.
1387	1389	- You think things will be different this time ? - They are.
1389	1393	When she calls me now, she's a different person. She's frightened, vulnerable.
1393	1397	She's finishing college and about to enter the real world. That's scary for anyone.
1397	1399	- Shit, l gotta place an order. - Talkin' to myself here.
1399	1403	- I'm listening. She's leaving college and-- - And she's looking for support.
1403	1406	- l think this is leading our relationship to a new level. - What about Veronica ?
1406	1409	I think the arguments Veronica and l are having are some kind of manifestation...
1409	1411	of a subconscious desire to break up with her,
1412	1414	so l can pursue a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
1414	1417	- Caitlin's on the same wavelength ? - it's safe to say yes.
1417	1420	- l think all four of you better sit down and talk it over. - All four ?
1420	1424	You, Veronica, Caitlin and Caitlin's fiancé.
1433	1437	- Do you sell video tapes ? - Yeah. What are you looking for ?
1437	1440	- Happy Scrappy Hero Pup. - Uh, one second.
1441	1444	I'm on the phone with the distribution house. Let me make sure they got it.
1444	1447	- What's it called again ? - Happy Scrappy Hero Pup.
1447	1451	- [ Child ] Happy Scrappy-- - She loves it. - Obviously.
1451	1455	This is RST Video calling. Customer number 4352.
1455	1457	I'd like to place an order.
1458	1460	I need one each of the following tapes:
1460	1462	Whispers in The Wind, To Each His Own,
1462	1465	Put it Where it Doesn't Belong, My Pipes Need Cleaning,
1465	1468	All Tit Fucking, Volume Eight, I Need Your Cock,
1469	1472	Ass Worshipping Rim Jobbers, My Cunt And Eight Shafts,
1472	1476	Cum Clean, Cum Gargling Naked Sluts, Cum Buns III,
1476	1479	Cumming in Socks, Cum On ilene,
1479	1481	Huge Black Cocks With Pearly White Cum,
1482	1484	Girls Who Crave Cock, Girls Who Crave Cunt,
1484	1488	Men Alone II: The KY Connection, Pink Pussy Lips,
1488	1491	oh, yeah, and, uh, All Holes Filled with Hard Cock.
1491	1495	Yup. Oh, wait a minute. What was that called again ?
1495	1497	I'm a needle, you know
1497	1502	Never want to be a haystack
1502	1505	Don't ever want to break your heart in two
1505	1509	Know the crowd is gonna sell their soul
1509	1512	Take it anywhere l know Well, l promise you
1512	1514	it's making me sick
1515	1519	Yes, I'd like to check on a misprint in today's edition.
1519	1521	Today's edition.
1521	1525	It says, ""Bree to wed Asian design major.""
1525	1527	No, everything's spelled fine.
1527	1530	I was just wondering if the article was a misprint.
1530	1533	I don't know, Like a typographical error or something.
1533	1538	Maybe it should say, ""Caitlin Bray"" or ""Caitlin Bre"" with one ""E.""
1538	1543	I'm a curious party. A curious party.
1543	1545	I'm an ex-boyfriend, and, well,
1545	1548	I talk to her all the time and she never mentioned this engagement.
1548	1551	That's why I'm thinking maybe it's a misprint.
1553	1558	Are you sure ? Maybe there's a vindictive printer working for you.
1558	1562	Meaning like, someone who asked her out once and got shot down,
1562	1567	and this is his revenge by putting this bogus article in the paper when it went to press.
1567	1569	Hello. Hello ?
1576	1578	- [ Sniffing ] - [ Cat Meows ]
1578	1582	I don't care if she's my cousin, I'm gonna knock those boots again tonight.
1582	1586	- Look who it is. The fuckin' human vacuum. - Scumbag, what are you doing ?
1586	1589	- Just hanging with Silent Bob and his cousin. - He's your cousin ?
1589	1591	- He's from Russia too. - No way.
1591	1595	- What part of Russia ? - l don't know. Do l look Like his fuckin' biographer ?
1595	1599	-Olaf, what part of Russia are you from? -Moscow.
1599	1603	-He only speaks Russian ? -He speaks some English, but he cannot speak it good like we do.
1603	1606	- Is he staying here ? - Nah, he's moving to the big city this week.
1606	1609	- He wants to be a metal singer. - [ Girl ] No way.
1609	1611	I swear. Olaf, metal.
1611	1615	That's his fucking metal face. Olaf, girl nice ?
1615	1618	- [ Speaks Russian ] - That's fucked up, man.
1618	1621	- What did he say ? - l don't know, man, but this guy's a character.
1621	1624	- He really wants to play metal ? - Yeah, he's got his own band in Moscow.
1625	1628	- it's called ""Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans"" or something. - That doesn't sound metal.
1628	1631	You gotta hear him sing. Olaf, ""Berserker.""
1632	1635	- Come on, man, ""Berserker"" ! - Does he sing in English or Russian ?
1635	1638	In English. Come on, ""Berserker."" Girls think sexy.
1640	1644	- Aah. Aah. - Watch, he's gonna sing it. It's too funny.
1644	1648	My love for you is like a truck, berserker
1648	1653	Would you like some making fuck, berserker
1653	1656	- That's fuckin' funny, man. - Did he say, ""making fuck"" ?
1656	1661	[ Science Fiction Movie Sounds, Man Screaming ]
1661	1663	[ Sounds Stop ]
1676	1681	My love for you is ticking clock, berserker
1681	1686	Would you like to suck my cock, berserker
1686	1689	That's beautiful, man.
1693	1695	Hold on to the counter and I'll pull.
1696	1699	Usually l just turn the can upside down.
1699	1701	Maybe we oughta soap your hand up.
1701	1704	They oughta put a warning on these things, like they do with cigarettes.
1705	1707	- l think it's coming ! - [ Falls On Floor ]
1709	1713	Thanks. l thought l was going to have to go to the hospital.
1713	1716	I'll throw this out as a precautionary measure.
1716	1718	[ Chuckling ] Stings a little.
1718	1722	A little word of advice: Sometimes you got to let those hard-to-reach chips go.
1722	1724	- [ Door Opens ] - Thanks.
1726	1729	You know, that article's accurate. Caitlin really is getting married.
1729	1732	-You know what l just watched ? -Me pulling a can off some moron's fist?
1733	1737	- Return Of The Jedi. - Didn't you hear me ? Caitlin is really getting married.
1737	1741	What did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back ?
1741	1743	- Empire. - Blasphemy.
1743	1745	Empire had the better ending.
1745	1750	I mean, Luke gets his hand cut off, finds out Vader's his father.
1750	1753	Han gets frozen, taken away by Boba Fett. it ends on such a down note.
1753	1757	I mean, that's what life is: a series of down endings.
1757	1759	All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
1759	1763	There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it 'til today.
1763	1765	- They build another Death Star, right ? - Yeah.
1765	1768	The first one was completed and fully operational before the rebels destroyed it.
1768	1771	Luke blew it up. Give credit where credit's due.
1771	1774	- The second one was still being built when they blew it up. - Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
1774	1777	Something just never sat right with me that second time around.
1777	1780	I could never put my finger on it, but something just wasn't right.
1780	1784	- And you figured it out. - The first Death Star was manned by the lmperial Army.
1784	1787	The only people on board were Storm Troopers, dignitaries, lmperialists.
1788	1791	- Basically. - So when they blew it up, no problem. Evil's punished.
1791	1795	- And the second time around ? - it wasn't even done being built yet.
1795	1797	- it was still under construction. - So ?
1798	1800	A construction job of that magnitude would require...
1800	1803	a lot more manpower than the lmperial Army had to offer.
1803	1806	I'll bet they brought independent contractors in on that thing.
1806	1809	- Plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers-- - Not just lmperialists.
1809	1811	- Is that what you're getting at ? - Exactly.
1811	1814	To get it built quickly and quietly, they'd hire anybody that could do the job.
1814	1817	You think the average Storm Trooper knows how to install a toilet main ?
1817	1821	- All they know is killing. - So they bring in independent contractors.
1821	1826	- Why are you so upset ? - Those innocent contractors brought in are killed,
1826	1829	casualties of a war they had nothing to do with.
1829	1833	Look, you're a roofer. Some juicy government contract comes your way.
1834	1836	You got a wife and kids, the two-story in suburbia.
1836	1840	This is a government contract which means all sorts of benefits.
1840	1842	Along come these left-wing militants who blast everything...
1842	1844	within a three-mile radius with their lasers.
1844	1846	You didn't ask for that; you had no personal politics.
1847	1850	- You're just trying to scrape out a living. - l don't mean to interrupt,
1850	1853	- but what are you talking about ? - The ending of Return Of The Jedi.
1853	1857	My friend is trying to convince me that independent contractors working on the Death Star...
1857	1860	were innocent victims when it was destroyed by the rebels.
1860	1863	I'm a contractor myself. I'm a roofer.
1863	1865	""Done And Ready Home improvements.""
1865	1868	Speaking as a roofer, l can tell you a roofer's personal politics...
1868	1871	- comes into play heavily when choosing jobs. - Like when ?
1871	1875	Three weeks ago, l was offered a job up in the hills. Beautiful house.
1875	1878	Tons of property. A simple re-shingling job.
1878	1882	They told me if l could finish it in one day, l would double my price.
1882	1884	- Then l realized whose house it was. - [ Dante ] Whose house was it ?
1884	1888	- Dominic Bambino's. - Baby Face Bambino ? The gangster ?
1888	1892	The same ! The money was right, but the risk was too high.
1892	1896	I knew who he was, and based on that, I turned the job over to a friend.
1896	1899	- Based on personal politics. - Right !
1899	1903	The next week, the Foresie family put a hit on Baby Face's house.
1903	1908	- My friend was shot and killed. Didn't even finish re-shingling. - No way.
1908	1912	I'm alive because l knew the risk involved in that particular client.
1912	1914	My friend wasn't so lucky.
1914	1918	Any contractor working on that Death Star knew the risk involved.
1918	1921	If they got killed, it's their own fault.
1921	1924	A roofer listens to this, not his wallet.
1934	1939	They say so much, but they never tell you if it's any good.
1942	1945	Are either one of these any good ?
1945	1947	- Sir ? - What ?
1947	1951	- Are either one of these any good ? - l don't watch movies.
1951	1954	[ Sighs ] Well, have you heard anything about either one of them ?
1954	1958	I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
1958	1962	You mean you haven't heard anybody say anything about either one of these ?
1962	1964	Nope.
1964	1966	[ Sighs ]
1968	1971	- Well, what about these two ? - They suck.
1971	1975	[ Sighs ] These are the same two movies.
1975	1978	- You weren't paying any attention. - No, l wasn't.
1978	1981	I don't think your manager would appreciate it--
1981	1984	- l don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am. - l beg your pardon ?
1984	1987	Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
1987	1992	I was only pointing out that you weren't paying any attention to what l was saying.
1992	1994	And l hope it feels good.
1994	1997	- You hope what feels good ? - l hope it feels so good to be right.
1997	1999	There's nothing more exhilarating...
1999	2001	than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there ?
2002	2005	[ Heavy Sigh ] Well, this is the last time l rent here !
2005	2008	- You will be missed. - Screw you !
2010	2015	- Hey, you're not allowed to rent here anymore ! - [ Jay ] Yeah !
2015	2017	Screw me ?
2030	2033	- You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said. - Wait.
2033	2036	- She in here ? - This guy's going through all the eggs.
2036	2039	This has been going on for 20 minutes now.
2039	2041	- What's he looking for ? - Said he has to find the perfect dozen.
2041	2044	- Perfect dozen ? - Each egg has to be perfect.
2044	2047	- The quest isn't going well ? - Obviously not.
2047	2050	- Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade. - Why doesn't he mix and match ?
2050	2053	- l told him that, and he yelled at me. - What'd he say ?
2053	2056	He said it was important to have standards. He says no one has any pride anymore.
2056	2058	It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
2058	2061	I give him five more minutes. After that, I'm calling the cops.
2061	2064	I don't need this. I'm not even supposed to be here today.
2066	2068	Two packs of cigarettes.
2070	2074	- I'm as puzzled as you. - I've actually seen it before.
2074	2077	- You know him ? - No, but l know the behavior.
2077	2080	- Let me guess. He's looking for the perfect carton of eggs ? - [ Randal ] How'd you know ?
2080	2084	- I'll bet you a million dollars he's a guidance counselor. - [ Dante ] Why do you say that ?
2084	2088	I saw it happen in Food City, Like, last year. Different guy, though.
2088	2091	Stock boy said he'd been looking through cartons of eggs for half an hour,
2091	2094	doing all sorts of endurance tests and stuff.
2094	2096	I asked him why nobody ever called the manager, and he said it happens...
2096	2099	two, three times a week, sometimes more.
2099	2101	- Get out of here. - No, l kid you not.
2101	2104	They call it shell shock. Seems to only happen with guidance counselors.
2104	2107	They used to make a big deal of it, but they just let it go now...
2107	2110	because they always pay for whatever they break, and they never bother anybody.
2110	2112	Why guidance counselors ?
2112	2115	If your job was as meaningless as theirs, wouldn't you go crazy too ?
2115	2119	- Come to think of it, my guidance counselor was kinda worthless. - See ?
2119	2121	It's important to have a job that makes a difference, boys.
2122	2127	That's why l manually masturbate caged animals for artificial insemination.
2129	2132	Go your own way
2132	2138	You can call it another lonely day
2161	2165	Did you ever notice that all the prices end in ""9"" ?
2165	2167	Damn, that's eerie.
2167	2171	- Do you know how much the average jiz-mopper makes per hour ? - What's a jiz-mopper ?
2171	2174	The guy that cleans up the nudie booths after each guy jerks off.
2175	2177	- ""Nudie booth"" ? - Yeah, nudie booth.
2177	2179	- You ever been in a nudie booth ? - Guess not.
2179	2181	Oh, man, it's great.
2181	2184	You go into this booth, and there's this glass between you and these chicks.
2184	2187	- And they put on a show for you for, like, ten bucks. - What kind of a show ?
2187	2190	Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.
2190	2194	These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening on their body.
2194	2197	- Any opening. - Can we not talk about this now ?
2197	2200	The jiz-mopper's job is to clean it up after each guy shoots a load.
2200	2202	Practically everybody does it right on the window.
2202	2205	I don't know if you know this, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away.
2205	2208	- l will never come to this place again. - Excuse me ?
2208	2212	Using filthy language in front of the customers. You both should be fired.
2212	2216	Oh, l-I'm sorry. I guess we kinda got carried away.
2216	2219	I don't know if sorry can make up for it.
2219	2222	You've highly offended me.
2222	2225	Well, if you think that's offensive, check this out.
2225	2227	Oh ! [ Screaming ]
2227	2230	- l think you can see her kidneys. - Why do you do things like that ?
2230	2233	- You know he's only going to come back and tell the boss. - Who cares ?
2233	2236	That guy's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight.
2236	2239	This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
2239	2242	- Jesus ! I'm gonna hear from the boss tomorrow. - Would you loosen up ?
2242	2245	You'd feel a lot better if you'd just rip into the occasional customer.
2245	2248	Why ? l-l don't bother them and they don't bother me.
2248	2253	Liar ! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
2253	2256	- There aren't ! - How can you lie like that ?
2256	2261	Why don't you vent ? Vent your frustrations. Who pisses you off ?
2261	2265	Well, l guess it isn't customers in particular.
2265	2268	Maybe just a group of customers.
2268	2272	- Well, let's hear it. - Well, the Milk Maids.
2272	2274	The Milk Maids ?
2274	2278	The women that go through every gallon of milk, looking for that later date,
2278	2281	as if somewhere beyond all the other gallons is a container of milk...
2281	2284	that won't go bad for like a decade.
2284	2288	You know who l can do without ? The people in the video store.
2288	2290	- Which ones ? - All of 'em.
2290	2294	What would you get for a six-year-old boy who chronically wets his bed ?
2294	2297	So, do you have any new movies in ?
2297	2302	Do you have that one with that guy who was in that movie that was out last year ?
2302	2304	They never rent quality flicks.
2304	2307	They always pick the most intellectually devoid movie on the racks.
2307	2310	Oooh ! Navy SEALS !
2310	2313	It's like in order to join they have to have an I.Q. less than their shoe size.
2313	2317	You think you get stupid questions ? You should hear the barrage that l get.
2317	2320	What do you mean there's no ice ? I've got to drink this coffee hot ?
2320	2323	So, how much is this thing anyway ?
2325	2328	Do you sell hubcaps for a '72 Pinto hatchback ?
2328	2330	Ooh ! Mini-Trucker magazine.

2383	2386	- What did he say ? - He said at least he wasn't 36.
2386	2388	And that made you feel better ?
2388	2392	And he said most of them were college guys l never even seen or met before.

3100	3103	You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
3103	3106	- Who found him ? - My cousin ? Mom found him.
3106	3110	It was a mess. He was on his bed, his legs doubled over himself.

3169	3172	Nobody's there. It's 4:00 on a Saturday.

3774	3776	- You saw it. - Very dramatic, l thought.
3776	3779	- it is not what you think. - Oh, it's not what l think.
3779	3782	What is it, worse ? You're pregnant with the Asian design major's child ?
3782	3784	- What's goin' on here ? - l am not pregnant.
3784	3786	Were you gonna tell me, or were you gonna send me an invitation ?
3786	3790	I was gonna tell you, but we were getting along so well, I didn't wanna mess it up.
3790	3792	You could've broken it to me gently.
3792	3795	You could've started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you l had a girlfriend.
3795	3799	I know. I'm sorry, but when we started talking, it was like l forgot l had a boyfriend.
3799	3801	- And then he proposed last month. - And you said yes.
3801	3803	Well, kind of. Sort of.
3803	3806	Is that what they teach you in that school of yours ? ""Kind of,"" ""sort of"" ?
3806	3809	Everybody knows about this except me ! Do you know how humiliating that is ?
3809	3812	I would've told you, and you would've stopped calling me, like a baby.
3812	3814	- How do you know that ? - Because l know you.
3814	3817	You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
3817	3819	- So you're really getting married ? - No.
3819	3821	- You're not really getting married ? - [ Scoffs ]
3821	3826	The story goes like this: He proposed, I told him l had to think about it,
3826	3828	and he insisted that l wear the ring anyway.
3828	3830	Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
3830	3833	- Oh, how like her. - Then my mother called this morning...
3833	3835	to let me know that the announcement was in the paper.
3836	3839	That's when l hopped a train to come back here, because l knew you'd be a wreck.
3839	3841	- Thanks for the vote of confidence. - Was l right ?
3841	3843	""Wreck"" is a harsh term.
3843	3846	""Disturbed"" is more like it. ""Mildly disturbed,"" even.
3846	3849	Oh, l love a macho facade. It is such a turn-on.
3849	3853	- What smells like shoe polish ? - So you came here to what ? To comfort me ?
3853	3856	The last thing l needed was for you to think l was hiding something from you.
3856	3859	- But you were ! - No, l wasn't ! Not really.
3859	3861	I told you I'd been seeing other people.
3861	3864	Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle.
3864	3866	I think that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
3866	3869	- What's going on ? - I'm giving him his ring back.
3869	3871	- What ? - [ Sighs ] l don't want to marry him.
3872	3874	I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation.

3881	3883	when I'm gonna fit in the other stuff.
3883	3885	I have come way too far and studied too damn hard...
3885	3888	to let my education go to waste as a housewife.
3888	3890	And l know that's what I'd become.
3890	3894	Sang's just signed with a major firm, and he's gonna be pulling in a huge salary,
3894	3896	which would give me no reason to work.
3896	3898	- He's very traditional. - Wait a minute.
3898	3902	- His name is ""Sang"" ? Past tense ? - Stop it. He's a nice guy.
3902	3904	Well, if he's so nice, why aren't you marrying him ?
3904	3907	- l just told you. - There's more to this, isn't there ?
3908	3910	Oh ! Why, Mr. Hicks, whatever do you mean ?

3916	3918	I just believe in giving credit where credit's due,
3918	3920	and l believe I'm the impetus behind your refusal to wed.
3920	3924	If I'm so nuts about you, then why am l having sex with an Asian design major ?
3924	3927	Oh, Jesus. You're so caustic.
3927	3929	I had to knock you down from that cloud you were floating on.
3929	3932	When l say l don't want to get married, I mean just that.
3932	3935	I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
3935	3937	Who's asking ? I don't want to marry you.
3937	3940	Well, good. Keep in that frame of mind.
3940	3943	- Well, let's date. - Oh, l think Sang and... Veronica,
3943	3945	they'd love that.

3952	3954	It's just the shock of seeing me after three years.

4372	4376	Do you always talk this weird after you violate a woman ?
4376	4378	Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium.
4378	4382	- Could be. - it has never been like that before.
4382	4384	Like what ?
4384	4388	When you just lay perfectly still and let me do everything.
4388	4390	Am l missing something here ?
4390	4391	Okay.
4392	4394	I went back there and Dante was already waiting for me.
4394	4397	- He was ? - it was so cool.
4397	4400	He didn't say a word. He didn't have to.
4400	4403	[ Sighs ] He was just... ready.
4403	4407	You know. And, like, we didn't kiss or talk or anything.
4407	4409	He just sat there and let me do all the work.
4409	4412	You dog ! I didn't even see you go back there.
4412	4415	The fact that there weren't any lights on made it so--
4415	4417	God, that was so great !
4417	4419	My legs are still shaking.
4421	4423	- it wasn't me. - [ Scoffs ]
4423	4426	Yeah, right. Who was it, then ? Randal ?
4426	4428	- Was it you ? - l was up here the whole time.
4428	4431	- You two better quit it. - I'm serious.
4431	4434	Oh, so we didn't just have sex in the bathroom ?
4434	4436	No.
4439	4441	Stop it. This isn't funny.
4441	4444	I'm not fooling around. I just came in from outside.
4444	4447	- This isn't fucking funny, Dante. - I'm not kidding.
4447	4449	- Who went back there ? - Nobody. l swear.
4449	4451	- l feel nauseous. - Are you sure there was someone back there ?
4452	4454	Well, l didn't just fuck myself ! Jesus Christ !
4454	4456	- God, I'm gonna be sick ! - You just fucked a total stranger ?
4457	4458	- Shut the fuck up ! - l can't believe this.
4459	4460	- Call the police. - Why ? - No, don't !
4461	4462	There's a stranger in our bathroom ! He just raped Caitlin !
4463	4465	- She said she did all the work. - Will you shut the fuck up ?
4465	4467	Who the fuck's in our bathroom ?
4468	4470	[ Woman ] Who is he ?
4470	4474	[ Dante ] l don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
4474	4476	- What time was this ? - l don't know.
4476	4478	What time did hockey end ?
4478	4480	Um, like 3:00, 3:30.
4480	4482	-What time we get back from the funeral? -4:00, l think.
4483	4485	- Wait. Who was working here ? - Just me.
4485	4488	I thought you just said you went to play hockey and then went to a funeral.
4488	4491	- Yeah, we did. - Then who was operating the store ?
4491	4494	- Nobody. it was closed. - With this guy locked in here ?
4494	4497	Well, everything happened so quickly, I guess l forgot he was back there.
4497	4499	- [ Man ] Can we take it now ? - Go ahead.
4505	4507	Was he alive when Caitlin--
4507	4510	No. l place the time of death about 3:20.
4510	4513	Then how could she-- You know.
4513	4516	[ Coroner ] The body can maintain an erection after expiration, sometimes for hours.
4516	4518	Did he have the adult magazine when he came in ?
4518	4520	Uh, no. l gave it to him.
4521	4523	He asked me for it.
4523	4526	I can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is...
4526	4529	he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died.
4529	4531	That's when the girl found him. [ Sniffing ]
4531	4533	Uh, something smells Like shoe polish.
4533	4536	This has got to be the weirdest thing you've ever been called in on.
4536	4540	Actually, l once had to tag a kid that broke his neck trying to put his mouth on his penis.
4540	4542	What about Caitlin ?
4542	4546	[ Coroner ] Shock trauma. She's gonna need years of therapy after this.
4546	4549	My question is: How did she come to have sex with a dead man ?
4549	4552	She thought it was me.
4552	4555	What kind of convenience store do you run here ?
4563	4568	[ Siren Blaring ]
4574	4579	[ Humming ""Theme from Jaws"" ]
4582	4583	Salsa shark.
4583	4585	""We're gonna need a bigger boat.""
4588	4591	Man goes into cage, cage goes into salsa.
4591	4594	Shark's in the salsa. Our shark.
4595	4597	Oh, what ? What's with you, man ?
4597	4600	You haven't said anything for, like, 20 minutes. What the hell's your problem ?
4600	4602	- [ Sighs ] This life. - ""This life"" ?
4603	4604	Why do l have this life ?
4605	4606	Have some chips. You'll feel better.
4607	4610	I'm stuck in this pit, working for less than slave wages,
4610	4612	working on my day off.
4612	4614	The goddamn steel shutters are closed.
4614	4617	I deal with every backward-assed fuck on the planet.
4617	4619	I smell like shoe polish.
4619	4622	My ex-girlfriend is catatonic after fucking a dead guy,
4622	4625	and my present girlfriend has sucked 36 dicks.
4625	4628	- Thirty-seven. - My life's in the shitter right now,
4628	4630	and if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
4630	4632	- [ Man ] You open ? - Yeah.
4634	4636	[ Randal ] Aw, that's all bullshit, man.
4636	4639	- You know what the real problem here is ? - l was born ?
4639	4642	- You should shit or get off the pot. - l should shit or get off the pot.
4642	4645	- Yeah, shit or get off the pot. - What are you talking about ?
4645	4648	I'm talking about this thing you have, this inability to improve your station in life.
4648	4650	- Fuck you ! - it's true, man.
4651	4653	You sit there and blame life for dealin' you a cruddy hand,
4653	4656	never once accepting responsibility for the way your situation is.
4656	4659	- What responsibility ? - All right, if you hate this job and the people...
4659	4663	and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, why don't you quit ?
4663	4665	- Like it's that easy. - it is. You just up and quit.
4665	4668	There's other jobs. They pay better money.
4668	4671	You're bound to be qualified for at least one of 'em. So what's stoppin' you ?
4671	4673	- Leave me alone. - Oh, you're comfortable, right ?
4673	4676	This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it...
4676	4679	would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
4679	4681	Oh ! Like your life's any better.
4681	4684	I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me complaining.
4684	4686	You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
4687	4689	Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store ?
4689	4691	- it's the same thing with Veronica. - Leave her out of this !
4691	4694	You date Veronica because it's convenient and she's low maintenance.
4694	4696	But meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin.
4697	4699	You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school.
4699	4702	- in high school, for God's sakes. You're 22. - Leave me alone !
4702	4706	If you want Caitlin, then talk to Veronica and be with Caitlin.
4706	4708	If you want Veronica, then be with Veronica.
4708	4710	But don't pine for one and fuck the other.
4710	4712	Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward--
4712	4714	If l wasn't such a fucking coward.
4714	4717	It must be great to have this ability to simplify things the way you do.
4717	4719	- Am l right or what ? - You're wrong !
4719	4723	Things happened today. Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
4723	4726	Oh, what, the dead guy ? She'll get over fuckin' a dead guy.
4726	4730	Shit, my mom's been fuckin' a dead guy for 30 years. l call him ""Dad.""
4730	4733	Caitlin and l can't be together. It's impossible.
4733	4736	Melodrama comin' from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
4736	4739	What do you want me to say ? ""Yes, some of the things you're saying are true"" ?
4740	4742	That's the way things are. They're not gonna change.
4742	4744	- Make 'em change. - l can't, all right ?
4744	4746	Jesus, will you leave me alone ?
4746	4749	I can't make changes in my life Like that. lf l could, l would.
4749	4752	But l don't have the ability to risk the comfortable situations...
4752	4754	on the big money and the fabulous prizes !
4754	4758	- Who are you kidding ? You can so. - Jesus H. Christ ! l can't !
4758	4763	So you're gonna be miserable 'cause you don't have the guts to face change ?
4763	4766	My mother told me once that when l was three years old,
4766	4768	my potty lid was closed,
4768	4771	and instead of me lifting it, I shit my pants.
4771	4773	Lovely story.
4773	4775	The point is, I'm not the type of person...
4775	4778	who'll disrupt things just so l can shit comfortably.
4792	4795	- [ Door Opening ] -  Noise, noise, noise Smokin' weed, smokin' weed

4802	4804	Done poisoning the youth for today, huh ?
4804	4806	Hell, yes, whatever that means.
4806	4809	Now it's time to head over to Atlantic, drink some beers,
4809	4811	get ripped and, hopefully, get laid.
4811	4813	- [ Dante ] One seventy-nine. - Pay the good man.
4815	4817	- Yeah, you close soon ? - in half an hour.
4817	4819	Yeah, we get off the same time every day.
4819	4822	- We should hang out. You get high ? - l should start.
4822	4824	Wanna come to this party tonight ? There's gonna be some pussy there.
4824	4826	With you ? l don't think so.
4826	4829	Oh, look at you. ""l don't hang out with drug dealers.""
4829	4832	- Nothing personal. - What happened with that old guy ?
4832	4835	- He died in the bathroom. - l heard he was jerkin' off or something.
4835	4837	I don't know. I wasn't watching.
4837	4841	He probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know l felt like beatin' it when l saw her.
4841	4843	Oh, come here, bitch. You like this ? Huh ?
4843	4846	- This what you want ? - Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend, all right ?
4846	4848	Oh, you used to go out with her ?
4848	4851	Yeah, well, l thought we might be starting again.
4851	4854	- Don't you already have a girlfriend ? - [ Dante ] Yeah, Veronica.
4854	4858	- And what, you're gonna dump her for that Caitlin chick ? - Maybe.
4858	4861	I don't know, dude. That Caitlin chick's nice, but l see that Veronica girl...
4861	4863	doin' shit for you all the time.
4863	4866	I saw her rubbin' your back, fuckin' comes and brings your food.
4866	4868	-Didn't l see her change your tire once? -Hey, l jacked up the car.
4869	4871	All she did was unloosen the nuts and put the tire on.
4871	4875	- Well, l know she does a lot for you. - She's my girlfriend.
4875	4879	I had some girlfriends too, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.
4879	4881	Shit, my grandmother used to say, ""What's better ?
4881	4884	Fuckin' a good plate with nothin' on it ?""
4884	4887	No, wait. l fucked up. ""What's a good plate with nothin' on it ?""
4887	4889	Meaning ?
4889	4893	I don't know. She was senile. She used to fuckin' piss herself all the time...
4893	4895	and shit herself.
4895	4898	Come on, Silent Bob. Let's get the fuck outta this fuckin' gyp joint...
4898	4900	with this fuckin' faggot Dante.
4900	4902	You cock smoker.
4903	4906	You know, there's a million fine-lookin' women in the world, dude,
4906	4908	but they don't all bring ya Lasagna at work.
4908	4910	Most of 'em just cheat on ya.
4910	4912	[ Jay ] Come on, limp dick !
4912	4915	[ Silent Bob ] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4916	4918	He's right.
4918	4921	I love her.
4921	4925	So that's it. He doesn't love you anymore. He loves Caitlin.
4925	4927	And he told you all of this ?
4927	4931	Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part. That's just my theory.
4931	4934	Uh-- l don't know what to say.
4934	4938	Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system.
4938	4941	It's not your fault. it's Dante.
4941	4944	I-Look. l don't know thing one about chicks.
4944	4947	So if you gotta cry or something, I can get outta here.
4947	4949	- I'm not sad. - You're not ?
4949	4951	Ow ! What'd you do that for ?
4951	4954	If you didn't wanna go out with me anymore, why didn't you say so ?
4954	4957	Instead you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back !
4957	4960	- What are you talking about ? - You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks !
4960	4962	- it was only a few times. - Then you pull that shit this morning,
4962	4964	freaking out because I've gone down a couple of guys.
4964	4967	- Oh, a couple ? - I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex,
4967	4969	sneaking around behind your back !
4969	4972	If you think 37 dicks are a lot, just wait and see, mister.
4972	4975	I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys l go down on now !
4975	4977	- Will you let me explain ? - Explain what ?
4977	4980	How you've been waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her ?
4981	4983	- it isn't like that ! - Damn right it isn't like that !
4983	4986	Because l won't let it be like that. You want your slut ? Fine, the slut is yours.
4986	4989	- l don't want Caitlin. - You don't know what you want !
4989	4992	But I'm not going to sit here holding your hand anymore until you figure it out !
4992	4994	I've tried with you, Dante.
4994	4997	I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school,
4997	5000	to take charge of your life and find direction.
5000	5002	I even transferred so maybe you'd be more inclined...
5002	5004	to go back to college if l was with you.
5004	5006	Everyone said it was a stupid move, but l didn't care...
5006	5008	because l loved you and wanted to see you...
5008	5011	pull yourself out of this senseless funk that you've been in...
5011	5013	since that whore dumped you oh, so many years ago.
5013	5015	Now you wanna go back to her so she can fuck you over some more !
5015	5018	- l don't wanna go back-- - Of course not ! Not now !
5018	5021	You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do !
5021	5023	Well, l won't let you.
5023	5026	I want you to follow through on this so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are !
5026	5029	And when she dumps you again-- and l promise you, she will--
5029	5031	I want to laugh in your face so you realize that...
5031	5033	that was what you gave up our relationship for !
5033	5036	I'm just glad that Randal had the balls to tell me since you couldn't !
5036	5039	- Randal ? - And having him tell me, that was just the weakest move ever.
5039	5041	- You're spineless ! - Veronica, l love you !
5041	5043	Fuck you !
5043	5046	[ Gong Ringing ]
5059	5061	Dante ?
5063	5066	Our problems seem a world away
5068	5070	Close your eyes
5070	5073	And they'll all go away
5073	5077	Close the night and listen
5077	5081	Close your eyes to me
5082	5084	And sell the lie
5084	5087	My face
5087	5089	Shall live
5089	5092	You'll all be replaced
5092	5095	How's your eye ?
5095	5098	The swelling's not that bad, but the F.D.S. stings.
5099	5102	- How's your neck ? - it's kinda hard to swallow.
5104	5106	You didn't have to choke me, you know.
5106	5109	Why did you tell Veronica that l was gonna dump her to go back with Caitlin ?
5110	5113	- l thought l was doing you a favor. - Oh, Jesus.
5113	5115	You're always saying how you can't initiate change yourself.
5115	5117	I thought I'd give you a hand.
5117	5119	Thanks.
5119	5121	You still didn't have to choke me.
5121	5124	Oh, please. I'm surprised l didn't kill you.
5124	5126	- Why do you say that ? - Why do l say that ?
5126	5128	Randal-- [ Sighs ] Forget it.
5128	5131	- No, really. What did l do that was so wrong ? - What don't you do ?
5131	5134	Sometimes l think the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
5135	5137	- How do you figure ? - What time did you get to work today ?
5137	5139	Like 10:00, or ten after.
5139	5143	You were over a half an hour late. And then all you do is come in here.
5143	5146	- Yeah, to talk to you. - Which means the video store is ostensibly closed !
5146	5148	Oh, it's not like I'm miles away.
5148	5150	Unless you're out renting video at other video stores.
5151	5155	- Hermaphrodites. l rented it so we could watch it together. - You get me slapped with a fine.
5155	5158	You argue with the customers, and l have to patch everything up.
5158	5160	You get us thrown out of a funeral by violating the corpse.
5160	5164	Then to top it all off, you ruin my relationship. I mean, what's your encore ?
5164	5168	Do you, like, anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank ?
5170	5174	You know what the real tragedy about all of this is ?
5174	5176	I'm not even supposed to be here today !
5176	5179	Oh, fuck you ! Fuck you, pal !
5179	5181	Jesus, there you go, trying to pass the buck.
5182	5183	I'm the source of all your misery.
5184	5187	Who closed the store to play hockey ? Who closed the store to go to a wake ?
5187	5189	Who tried to win back his ex-girlfriend...
5189	5192	without even discussing how he felt with his present one ?
5192	5195	You wanna blame somebody ? Blame yourself.
5195	5197	""I'm not even supposed to be here today.""
5197	5199	You sound like an asshole !
5199	5201	Jesus, nobody twisted your arm to be here.
5201	5203	You're here of your own volition.
5203	5206	You like to think the weight of the world rests on your shoulder,
5206	5209	Like this place would fall apart if Dante wasn't here.
5209	5212	Jesus, you overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job.
5212	5217	You push fuckin' buttons. Anybody could waltz in here and do our jobs.
5217	5220	You're so obsessed with making it seem so much more epic,
5220	5223	so much more important than it really is.
5223	5227	Christ, you work in a convenience store, Dante, and badly, l might add !
5228	5231	I work in a shitty video store, badly as well.
5231	5235	You know, that guy Jay's got it right. He has no delusions about what he does.
5235	5237	Us, we like to make ourselves seem so much more important...
5238	5241	than the people that come in here to buy a paper or, God forbid, cigarettes.
5241	5243	We look down on them as if we're so advanced.
5243	5245	Well, if we're so fuckin' advanced,
5245	5248	what are we doin' workin' here ?
5266	5269	Hey, the floor looks pretty clean. I put the cat next door.
5270	5273	- Need a ride home ? - No, l got one. Just pulled up.
5273	5275	You workin' tomorrow ?
5275	5277	Same time. What about you ?
5277	5280	I'm callin' out. Goin' to the hospital and visit Caitlin.
5281	5283	And then I'm gonna try to talk to Veronica.
5283	5285	You wanna grab a bite to eat or something...
5285	5287	when you're done with that and l get off work ?
5287	5290	- I'll give you a call, let you know. - All right.
5290	5292	Hey, good luck with Veronica.
5292	5295	- lf you want, l can talk to her, try and straighten this-- - No, thanks.
5295	5297	I think l can handle it.
5297	5300	We have a lot of shit to talk about.
5300	5303	- Hell of a day. - To say the least.
