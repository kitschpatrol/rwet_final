1912	1914	It's been almost 10 years. I have like 900 bucks left.

2882	2883	He's my boyfriend.
2885	2887	That's nice.
2887	2889	I've never met him before.
2889	2891	Well, he's a new boyfriend.
2891	2892	But a boyfriend.
2892	2895	So he came over for breakfast because he's your new boyfriend?
2895	2897	DEBBIE: Yeah. He came from his house.
2897	2899	Drove over to our house
2899	2902	because he thought it would be fun to have breakfast with us,
2902	2906	so he drove his car from his house to our house to have breakfast.
2906	2908	Because he likes breakfast so much.
2908	2910	I love breakfast.
2910	2915	You guys wanna hear something neat? We're gonna have a baby together.
2915	2917	SADIE: What? Yeah, a baby.
2917	2918	Well, you're not married.
2918	2920	Aren't you supposed to be married to have a baby?
2920	2922	You don't have to be.
2922	2924	But they should be because they love each other,
2924	2928	and people who love each other get married and have babies.
2928	2929	Mmm-mmm.
2929	2931	Do you love each other?
2931	2934	Yes, they love each other. Because that's what you do.
2934	2938	When you love each other, you get married and have a baby.
2938	2940	Where do babies come from?
2940	2942	DEBBIE: Where do you think they come from?
2942	2945	Well, I think a stork, he drops it down,
2945	2948	and then a hole goes in your body,
2948	2950	and there's blood everywhere, coming out of your head,
2950	2953	and then you push your belly button, and then your butt falls off,
2954	2957	and then you hold your butt and you have to dig,
2957	2959	and you'll find a little baby.
2959	2961	That's exactly right.
2961	2963	Feed the teddy bear.
2963	2966	Okay, I feed your bear the grass?
2968	2969	Okay.

2983	2985	He's playing fetch with my kids.
2986	2987	He's treating my kids like they're dogs.
2987	2989	No, he's not.
2989	2990	Go get it! Fetch!
2990	2992	DEBBIE: Who plays fetch with kids?
2992	2994	ALLISON: He's trying. He's making an effort.
2994	2997	BEN: Bring it back. He's overweight.
2997	2998	Where does that end?
2998	3000	How old is he? 23.
3000	3001	Looks 33.
3002	3005	He can barely get in and out of that little house.
3005	3007	Imagine how much bigger he's gonna get.
3007	3009	That means he has bad genes.
3009	3011	Your kid is gonna be overweight.

3036	3039	Oh, God. They go ape shit over bubbles.
3039	3040	They're really going ape shit.
3040	3043	I mean, that's an incredible thing about a child.
3044	3045	I mean, what's so great about bubbles?
3045	3048	They float. You can pop them. I mean, I get it. I get it.
3048	3052	I wish I liked anything as much as my kids like bubbles.
3052	3054	That's sad. It's totally sad.
3054	3059	Their smiling faces just point out your inability to enjoy anything.
3059	3061	Am I gonna be okay, man?
3062	3064	Oh, who knows?
3065	3067	Is anybody okay? I'm not okay.

3086	3088	I can't ref the next games, by the way.
3088	3091	I got to go meet gynecologists with Allison.
3091	3093	She doesn't like her gynecologist.
3093	3096	JAY: You think she likes you? She's trying to.
3097	3099	She's entertaining the idea of liking you. Exactly. I'll take that.
3099	3102	Yeah, well, see, she's bringing you to the gynaechiatrist.
3102	3104	She must like you. Yeah. Pretty good, I think.
3104	3107	You know who I'd like to get pregnant, is that Felicity Huffman, man.
3107	3109	Ever since Transamerica, I can't get her out of my mind.
3110	3112	Okay, guys. I hate to crack the whip,
3112	3114	but it's kind of business meeting time.
3114	3116	I need moolah.
3117	3119	When do you think we can launch this site? Jeez.
3119	3121	Look, man. You can't rush this.
3121	3122	You know what happens to these sites when they go up
3123	3124	and they don't function well? They die.
3124	3128	Seriously, guys, let's say I want to launch today.
3128	3131	Let's start. Let's use that as a jumping off point.
3131	3133	Let's make this happen. What can we do?
3133	3136	Look, man, I didn't go to Yale so I could work 12 hours a day.
3136	3137	I thought you went to Santa Monica City College.
3137	3139	I went where I went, Jason.
3139	3141	BEN: I'm not asking you to work 12 hours a day.
3141	3144	I mean, you guys watch movies without nudity in them.
3144	3146	I'll tell you what, man. We could probably get it online in three months.
3147	3148	Thank you. Yes! Three months.
3148	3150	JONAH: Come on, Jason!
3150	3152	Fuck off!
3152	3154	Yeah, well, you still have a little dick, Cartman.
3155	3157	Do you have mints? Yeah, right there.
3157	3159	I see what you're saying. Totally.
3159	3161	I don't get how you're comfortable with any of these guys
3161	3163	when they're doing what they're doing to you.
3163	3165	First guy...
3165	3168	Oh, there that shit is. I've been looking for that.
3168	3171	The first guy, when he put his finger in, he gave me this look like,
3171	3176	"Sorry, man, it's the job" and I'm like, "Don't look at me when your finger's..."
3176	3179	I mean, get in and get out. Get on with your day, you know?
3179	3183	That's the closest I'll ever come to being in a threesome, I think.
3183	3184	Really?
3184	3186	If you had to do a threesome with me and one of my other roommates,
3186	3188	who would it be?
3188	3189	Um...
3190	3191	I'm gonna have to go with Jay.
3191	3192	Oh, no.
3192	3193	Yeah. Jay?

3600	3601	Okay.
3603	3604	Yeah, I mean, she was acting weird,
3604	3606	and I really think it's just 'cause, like,
3606	3608	you know, I haven't made an honest woman out of her.
3608	3610	She's carrying my bastard child. No one wants that.
3610	3613	That's what I did. I mean, I married Debbie when she got pregnant.
3613	3614	You think she's, like, hiding me?
3614	3617	Like, she's, like, embarrassed by me or something like that?
3617	3619	Probably. I'd hide you.
3619	3621	How much do wedding rings cost?
3621	3622	I mean, it really depends, you know?
3622	3625	I think you're supposed to spend, like, three months' pay on a ring.

3661	3662	God damn it!
3662	3666	Well, shit, I saw it online at one point, but I guess I didn't connect the dots.
3666	3667	What are we gonna do now?
3667	3669	All we need to do is think of a new, better idea
3670	3671	that no one else has thought of already.

3674	3677	JONAH: Don't worry, man. We'll figure it out.
3682	3685	You know what?
3685	3688	I think just because this site exists
3688	3690	doesn't mean our site won't work, necessarily.
3690	3692	Good things come in pairs, man, you know.
3692	3693	Oh, for sure.

3699	3701	Panda Express, Yoshinoya Beef Bowl.
3702	3703	Exactly. We can work together.
3703	3705	This can help us, if anything, I think.
3706	3707	We're fine. We're golden.
3709	3712	Look, Allison, I'm sure this isn't how you pictured it being, exactly,
3713	3715	and it's not how I wanted it to be,
3715	3718	but that is why I'm presenting you this empty box.
3718	3720	It's a promise, Allison.
3720	3723	It's a promise that one day I will...
3723	3727	I will fill this box with a ring that you deserve, a beautiful ring.

6645	6647	I can't believe I said some of that.
6647	6648	That's all I think about in my head.
6648	6650	I don't wanna talk about it.
6650	6653	But maybe we could bring the baby into a reconciled place so we can talk...
6653	6656	No. I don't wanna go there.
6656	6659	Don't go there. Okay? Help me stay relaxed.
6659	6661	So, what should I do?
6661	6663	You need to call Dr. Howard.

6665	6670	Hello, yes, this is Ben Stone. I'm calling on behalf of Allison Scott.
6670	6672	We need Dr. Howard. It's an emergency.
6672	6674	Yeah. He's at San Francisco at bar mitzvah.
6675	6678	He's at a bar mitzvah in San Francisco? Do you know when he gets back?
6678	6680	In three days.
6681	6683	Do you have his cell number, by any chance?
6686	6689	Hey! Good news.
6689	6692	I got his number right here. I'm gonna call him right now.
6692	6695	Oh, great. Thank you so much. Oh, my God. I'm so glad you're here. Thank you.
6695	6698	I'm glad I'm here, too. Thank you.
6698	6700	I shouldn't have told you you were a fucking lunatic.
6700	6702	I shouldn't have said that. I feel terrible about it and...
6703	6705	No, it's okay. We're past it. We're past it.
6705	6707	I'm sorry I told you to fuck your bong.
6707	6709	It's okay. I didn't.
6709	6712	Let's just drop it now. We're over it.
6713	6716	I'm gonna call him right now. You're doing so great.
6716	6720	Hello, it's Dr. Howard. I'm not here right now. Please leave a message.

6724	6726	Guess what the fuck's up?
6726	6729	Allison's going into labor and you are not fucking here.
6729	6732	Now, where are you? You're at a fucking bar mitzvah in San Francisco,
6732	6734	you motherfucking piece of shit!
6734	6736	And you know what I'm gonna have to do now?
6736	6737	I'm gonna have to kill you.
6737	6739	I'm gonna have to pop a fucking cap in your ass.
6739	6741	You're dead! You're Tupac!

6757	6758	Hey. Hey.
6758	6759	Did you talk to him?
6759	6764	I didn't talk to him directly. I left him a very nice message, though.
6764	6767	And... Okay.
6767	6769	What I'm about to tell you isn't that bad.
6769	6771	You should know that going in.
6771	6774	We can get through this, and it's just a little hiccough,
6774	6775	but everything will be fine. Okay?
6776	6778	Do you trust me when I say everything will be fine?
6778	6780	I can deal with it. Okay.
6780	6784	So, Dr. Howard is at a bar mitzvah.
6784	6786	A bar mitzvah?
6786	6787	It's a Jewish rite of passage.
6787	6791	And he's gonna be there for the next three days,
6791	6794	so he will not be able to be here tonight.
6794	6796	Oh, no.
6798	6799	It's okay.
6800	6801	What do you think we should do?
6802	6803	Okay. I know exactly what to do.
6803	6806	All we do is we'll get in the car, I'll drive to the hospital,
6806	6808	and on the way, we will call every gynecologist we've met.
6809	6811	Someone will be available. You know?
6812	6813	Okay. I can do that. Okay. Good.
6814	6816	I mean, we still have time. I mean, how far apart are your contractions?
6816	6819	I think, like, seven minutes. Seven minutes!
6819	6821	See? Not until four minutes is it really coming.
6821	6823	And has your water broken, even?
6823	6825	I don't know. I'm in the tub.
6826	6828	That's a good point. Have you had your bloody show?
6828	6829	What? What's that?
6829	6832	It's, it's... I mean, it's a bloody mucusy discharge.
6832	6834	But it only comes out right before the baby's gonna come,
6834	6836	so if that hasn't happened, we have time.
6836	6839	We can make it to the hospital. It's no problem.
6839	6841	You read the baby books.
6841	6845	Yeah. I did. I read three of them, actually.

7082	7083	to tell me how to do my job.

7095	7097	and she needs to let go and let me do my job.
7097	7099	Look, she's just having a hard time
7099	7101	because her and our doctor had a very specific birth plan.
7102	7104	And they wanted it to be a very special experience.

7559	7561	Oh, my gosh. Oh, God.
7561	7563	Your face smells like an old man's balls.
7563	7565	Thank you. Thank you. Oh, fucking hell.
7567	7568	BEN: Hey.
7572	7575	Oh, my God.
7575	7577	Oh, hello.
7577	7579	Oh, my goodness.
7580	7582	She's beautiful.
7585	7586	Hello.
7586	7589	Oh. I love you, Ben. I love you, Debbie.
7589	7593	We're gonna have another baby. Okay.
7593	7594	Hello, baby.
7594	7596	Gentlemen, it's a girl!
7596	7598	[ ALL CHEERING ]
7601	7603	We got a daughter! Mazel tov!
7603	7606	Congratulations, Daddy! JAY: We got a beautiful little girl!
7606	7609	Let's meet her! She's awesome! JAY: A beautiful little girl!
7609	7613	And then your mommy said, "Just do it, already,"
7613	7616	which was very confusing to Daddy.
7616	7621	So I listened to the most literal translation of that and I just did it, already.
7621	7623	What would you do?
7623	7624	Don't tell Mommy,
7624	7629	but it was the smartest thing I ever did, listening to her, 'cause now you're here.
7629	7631	Isn't that nice? I think it is.
7637	7639	Hi, you.
7643	7645	I hope your apartment is big enough for the three of us.
7645	7646	BEN: Oh, it definitely is.
7647	7649	That's why I got one in East LA, the rent. It's huge!
7649	7651	The only thing is we have to decide
7651	7653	if we're gonna be Crips or Bloods before we get there.
7653	7656	Well, I look good in red. I look good in blue.
7656	7657	The fighting continues.
7657	7659	[ LAUGHING ]
7659	7661	We could just throw off everyone and become Latin Kings.
7661	7662	Yeah.
7662	7663	We both look good in gold.
7663	7665	[ LAUGHING ] Yeah.
7666	7667	Good choice.
7667	7671	[ CARS HONKING ] I would yell at you about driving so slow, except the baby's here.
7671	7674	No, these guys can honk all they want. I ain't going faster than 12.
7674	7676	It might take us around three hours to get home, though.
