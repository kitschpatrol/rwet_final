551	552	We sure do, Mr. Hat.
553	556	Let's start the day with a few new math problems.
556	558	What is five times two?
560	562	Don't be shy. Just give it your best shot.

631	634	-Nowhere. -We heard them from Mr. Garrison before.
635	637	l seriously doubt that Mr. Garrison ever said. . .
637	640	. . . ''Eat penguin shit, you ass-spelunker. ''
641	642	Sweet.
647	649	Thank you for coming on short notice.
650	651	This isn't like you, Stanley.
651	654	What did my son say, Mr. Mackey? Did he say the S-word?
654	656	No, it was worse than that.
656	657	The F-word?
657	661	Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
661	663	-Oh, dear God. -What the heck is a rim Job?
664	668	When you put your legs behind your head and have someone lick your ass.
670	675	Tell Mr. Mackey this instant where you heard all these horrible phrases!
675	678	We all swore ourselves to secrecy.
678	679	-The Terrance and Phillip movie. -Dude!
680	681	l wanna get out of here.
681	683	Terrance and Phillip? Those Canadians?
684	685	Excuse me. What is Terrance and Phillip?
686	689	Terrance and Phillip are two very untalented actors from Canada.
689	692	Nothing but foul language and toilet humor!
692	696	l'll send a warning to parents before more children see Terrance and Phillip.
696	697	Everybody's fucking seen it.
698	702	l can't help myself. That movie has warped my fragile little mind.
709	711	There's the girl that I like
713	715	Over there laughing with that smart--
716	718	You're holding up the goddamn lunch line!
719	721	Hello, there, children.
721	722	-Hey, Chef. -How's it going?
722	724	-Bad. -Why bad?
724	727	We got busted for swearing. We can't ever see that movie again.
727	728	That's too bad.
729	731	You should've seen Kyle when his mom showed up. He was scared.
731	734	-Shut up, Cartman! -l'd be scared. Your mom's a bitch.
735	736	Don't call her a bitch, you fat fuck!
737	738	Don't call me fat, you fucking son of a bitch!
739	741	Where did you learn to talk like that?
741	742	Pretty fucking sweet, huh?
743	746	How do you make a woman like you more than any other guy?
746	749	That's easy. You Just gotta find the clitoris.
750	752	What does ''find the clitoris'' mean?
752	754	Forget l said anything.
754	756	Move along. You're holding up the line.
756	758	Do you know where l can find the clitoris?
758	761	-The what? -ls that like finding Jesus?
761	762	Attention, students.
762	765	We are now enforcing a new dress code at South Park Elementary.
766	768	Terrance and Phillip shirts are not allowed in school.
768	772	Anyone wearing a Terrance and Phillip shirt is to be sent home immediately.
773	775	Hooray!
779	783	The Canadian film Asses of Fire is number one at the box office.
783	785	Is the film destroying American youth?
785	787	Here with a special report is a midget in a bikini.
788	791	The effects of the Canadian comedy are far-reaching indeed.
792	796	All over America, children seem to be influenced, like at this spelling bee.
796	798	This is for the silver medal.
798	800	Spell ''forensics. ''
801	803	Why should l fucking have to spell ''forensics''?
804	807	Here you go. S-U-C-K-M-Y-A-S-S.
808	809	Forensics.
809	813	The devastating impact of the duo can also be seen with their hit song...
813	816	... ''Shut Your Fucking Face, Uncle Fucker. ''
816	818	Shut your fucking face Uncle fucker
818	822	You're a boner-biting bastard Uncle fucker
822	824	I told you that we won 't stop
824	826	I told you that we won 't stop
826	827	Back to you, Tom.
827	829	Thanks. Shocking report.
829	831	The controversy began in the town of South Park...
831	834	... where the PTA is trying to ban the movie.
834	838	With us tonight is the head of the PTA, Sheila Broflovski.
838	841	-And the Canadian minister of movies. -Thanks for having me.
841	844	Parents are concerned about your country's entertainment.
844	846	The film isn 't intended for children--
847	848	But of course children will see it.
849	851	Can I finish? We're surprised by your outrage.
852	854	-You just don 't care! -Can I finish? Hello?
855	857	The U. S. has graphic violence on TV all the time.
857	860	We can 't believe a movie with foul language pisses you off.
860	862	-Because it's evil! -Can I finish?!
862	864	Please can I finish?!
865	866	Okay, I'm finished.
866	870	This film isn 't the first troublesome thing to come out of Canada.
870	871	Let's not forget Bryan Adams.
871	874	Our government's apologized for Bryan Adams on several occasions.
874	878	You Canadians are all the same, with your beady eyes and flapping heads.
879	880	I resent that! I find that racist--
880	883	Our children are now addicted to your puke!
883	884	You are a racist!
884	889	It'll take us weeks to erase the damage this film has done to our children.
891	895	Kids, l want to welcome you to rehabilitation, m'kay?
895	898	Your mothers insisted you be taken from your schoolwork. . .

1206	1208	What was that word, young man?
1222	1225	Little boy at peace
1225	1226	What is this place
1227	1229	Beyond the stars
1230	1232	Open up your eyes
1232	1234	What are these things
1234	1236	You're moving toward
1237	1239	Head so full of wonder
1240	1242	-Worries in the past
1242	1245	Could it be That you are free at last
1247	1248	No!
1255	1256	Little boy, you're going to hell
1257	1260	You said bad words, threw rocks at birds And now this is your hotel
1261	1263	This ain 't Disneyland, it's hell
1265	1267	Little boy, it's time for you to pay
1267	1270	For not going to church And staring at boobs every day

1275	1278	No, hell isn 't good Hell isn 't good, hell
1283	1285	Fuck-face, have you seen Gracie?
1285	1288	There is orderliness in the universe.
1302	1305	Parents, our children are out of control!
1305	1309	This is what happens when toilet humor is allowed to run rampant!
1309	1311	That's right. Kenny set himself on fire. . .
1311	1314	. . .because he saw Terrance and Phillip do it in that dirty movie.
1314	1317	We must stop dirty language from getting to our children's ears.
1317	1320	We must go fight the source of it!
1320	1321	But what is the source?
1321	1323	That's easy.
1324	1326	Times have changed Our kids are getting worse
1326	1329	They won 't obey their parents They just want to fart and curse
1330	1331	Should we blame the government
1331	1332	Or blame society
1333	1335	Or should we blame the images on TV
1335	1337	No, blame Canada!
1337	1338	Blame Canada
1339	1342	With all their beady little eyes And flappin ' heads so full of lies
1342	1343	Blame Canada
1343	1345	Blame Canada
1345	1347	-We need to form a full assault -It's Canada 's fault
1349	1351	Don 't blame me for my son Stan
1352	1355	He saw the darn cartoon And now he's off to join the Klan
1355	1357	And my boy Eric once Had my picture on his shelf
1358	1360	But now when I see him He tells me to fuck myself
1360	1362	Well, blame Canada
1362	1363	Blame Canada
1364	1366	It seems that everything's gone wrong Since Canada came along
1370	1373	They're not even a real country anyway
1373	1377	My son could've been a doctor Or a lawyer rich and true
1377	1380	Instead he burned up like a piggy On a barbecue
1380	1381	Should we blame the matches
1381	1385	Should we blame the fire Or the doctors who allowed him to expire
1385	1387	Heck, no! Blame Canada
1387	1389	Blame Canada
1389	1392	-With all their hockey hullabaloo -And that bitch Anne Murray too
1396	1399	The smut and trash we must bash The laughs and fun must be undone
1399	1401	We must lament and cause a fuss
1401	1404	Before somebody thinks of blaming us
1411	1413	All right, you turds, listen up!
1413	1417	Your moms are at a meeting and they put me in charge of you.
1417	1420	But you're still grounded, so you're not allowed to have any fun!

1988	1992	Wait a minute. This chip somehow knows if the child is swearing?
1992	1993	lt's like a lie detector.
1993	1996	Certain things happen to you when you swear, Just like when you lie.
1996	1999	The chip picks up on this and gives the subJect a little prick.
2000	2003	Patient B-5, would you step out here, please?

2058	2061	A full-scale attack was launched on Toronto...
2061	2065	...after the Canadians ' last bombing, which devastated the Arquettes.
2065	2068	For security measures, our great government is rounding up...
2068	2071	...all citizens with Canadian blood and putting them into camps.
2071	2075	Canadian-Americans are to report to one of these death camps right away.
2075	2077	Did I say ''death camps''?
2077	2079	I meant happy camps, where you will eat the finest meals...
2080	2082	...have access to fabulous doctors and exercise regularly.
2082	2086	Meanwhile, war criminals Terrance and Phillip are prepped for execution.
2086	2088	Their execution will take place...
2088	2092	...during a fabulous USO show, with guest celebrities, including...
2092	2094	...Big Gay Al and Winona Ryder.
2094	2098	Of course, the only way to see the USO show is to sign up for the Army!
2098	2102	So join the Army and kill some Canadian scum as we continue...
2102	2105	... the march of war. Eat Snacky Smores.
2108	2113	We must rid ourselves of anything Canadian.
2114	2116	Don't you like Terrance and Phillip anymore?
2117	2120	Course not! Mommy says l hate Canadians because they made me have a dirty mouth.
2120	2121	Burn it all!

2131	2132	-And you can't say ''shit''? -No.
2132	2135	You can't say, ''l'm Cartman, the fattest piece of shit in the world''?
2136	2137	-Fuck you! -Dude. Sweet!
2138	2141	This has gone far enough. lt's time we talked to our moms.
2141	2143	We're supposed to be grounded.
2143	2145	Come on, it's time for us to get political.
2145	2148	Canada will no longer corrupt our children!
2148	2150	Mom, can l talk to you?
2150	2153	Kyle, what are you doing here? You are grounded.
2153	2155	Get back to the house and stay there!
2155	2157	You too, Stanley.
2157	2160	You're going too far. You can't kill Terrance and Phillip.
2160	2162	We must fight for our children's futures!
2163	2166	-You started a war. You have to stop it. -To make them safe again!
2167	2169	Our children are precious.
2169	2173	We must make a stand now! Stop at nothing!
2174	2175	l told you she wouldn't listen.
2175	2177	We'll have to save Terrance and Phillip ourselves.
2178	2179	-What? -Think about it.
2179	2180	What would Brian Boitano do?
2181	2183	He'd rescue Terrance and Phillip before they're executed.
2183	2186	We can't do anything. Our moms' organization is too strong.
2186	2189	We'll round up all the grounded kids and start our own organization.
2189	2191	An organization to help save Terrance and Phillip.
2192	2194	Yeah, our own secret club.
2194	2196	-l guess that could work. -We have to try.
2197	2199	What would Brian Boitano do If he was here right now
2200	2203	He'd make a plan and follow through That's what Brian Boitano 'd do
2203	2206	When Brian Boitano was in the Olympics Skating for the gold
2207	2210	He did two salchows and a triple lutz While wearing a blindfold
2210	2213	When Brian Boitano was in the Alps Fighting grizzly bears
2213	2217	He used his magical fire breath And saved the maidens fair
2217	2220	So what would Brian Boitano do If he were here today
2220	2224	I'm sure he'd kick an ass or two That's what Brian Boitano 'd do
2224	2227	I want this V-chip out of me
2227	2230	It has stunted my vocabulary
2230	2234	And I just want my mom To stop fighting everyone
2234	2237	For Wendy, I'll be an activist That's what Brian Boitano 'd do
2237	2240	That's what Brian Boitano 'd do He'd call the kids in town
2240	2244	And tell them to unite for truth That's what Brian Boitano 'd do
2244	2246	Someone say my name?
2246	2248	-Who are you? -l'm Brian Dennehy.
2249	2251	What? No, not fucking Brian Dennehy!
2251	2253	Get the fuck out of here.
2254	2257	When Brian Boitano traveled through time To the year 301 0
2258	2261	He fought the evil robot king To save the human race again
2261	2264	When he built the pyramids He beat up Kublai Khan
2265	2269	Because Brian Boitano Doesn 't take shit from anybody
2270	2273	So let's all stick together And unite to stop our moms
2273	2276	We'll save Terrance and Phillip too That's what Brian Boitano 'd do
2277	2281	We'll save Terrance and Phillip too That's what Brian Boitano 'd do

2347	2350	ls sex the only thing that matters to you?
2350	2351	l love you.
2353	2354	l want to believe that.
2354	2357	What do you say we shut off that light and get close?
2362	2364	You like that, don't you, bitch?
2367	2370	We can use my dad's computer to call the kids together.
2370	2373	Before we put a message out, do a search on ''clitoris. ''
2376	2379	''Found: Eight million pages with the word 'clitoris.' ''
2379	2383	l'll Just try the first one. ''You must be 1 8 to enter this website. ''
2383	2385	''Welcome to German Sick Fetish Video.
2386	2389	lf you are under 1 8, do not--'' Well, okay.

2404	2405	Bullshitah.
2406	2407	What's she doing now?
2413	2414	Click it off, dude!
2414	2416	What's wrong with German people?
2416	2419	Let's do what we came here to do and put a message out.
2419	2422	l've gotta put out an all-access e-mail.
2422	2425	-Goddamn, your mom sucks! -Get to the message board!
2425	2427	Can't find a Canadian server. l'll break into the mainframe.
2428	2430	They've got an access code!
2430	2432	l'll try to re-route the encryptions.
2436	2438	Here we go. ''Want to help Terrance and Phillip?
2439	2443	Sneak out after you get tucked into bed tonight and meet at Carl's warehouse. ''
2443	2445	-Tell them we'll have punch and pie. -We're not.
2445	2448	More people will come if they think we have punch and pie!
2449	2450	''Punch and pie.
2451	2454	This is top-secret. The password is. . . . ''
2454	2456	''La RÈsistance. ''
2457	2459	So the draft will begin tomorrow...
2459	2462	...as more troops are needed to invade the Canadian border.
2462	2465	The Canadian government pleads for a peaceful resolution...
2465	2466	...but we're not listening.
2467	2468	Good night, hon.
2468	2470	Mom, when will the war be over?
2471	2475	l don't know, hon. Soon, we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
2477	2479	-Mom? -Yes, hon?
2479	2483	lf you were in a German scheiﬂe video, you'd tell me, right?
2484	2485	Sure, hon. Good night.
2496	2497	There's a ghost!
2499	2500	Kenny, is that you?
2503	2504	Satan? Satan is coming here?
2506	2508	Saddam Hussein? That doesn't make sense!
2512	2512	Eric, what is it?
2513	2514	l saw him! l saw Kenny!
2514	2516	You poor dear.
2516	2517	You've been through so much.
2518	2521	l bet him he couldn't light a fart on fire, and now he's pissed off.
2521	2522	l can't say ''pissed off''?
2525	2527	The execution of Terrance and Phillip is imminent.
2527	2530	Soon, Saddam and l will rule the world.
2532	2535	l got some new luggage for our trip up to Earth.
2535	2536	Let's fuck to celebrate!
2536	2539	What's it like up on Earth? Tell me about it again.
2539	2541	Let's not talk. Let's get busy.
2541	2543	Remember when you first got here?
2543	2546	We used to talk all night, until the sun came up.
2547	2549	We would Just lie in bed and talk.
2549	2552	Because l was waiting to get you in bed.
2552	2554	How come you always want to make love to me from behind?
2555	2557	ls it because you want to pretend l'm somebody else?
2557	2560	Satan, your ass is gigantic and red.
2560	2562	Who am l gonna pretend you are? Liza Minnelli?
2564	2566	Don't get all pissy!
2574	2577	Sometimes I think
2577	2580	When I look up real high
2580	2583	That there's such a big world up there
2583	2586	I'd like to give it a try
2587	2589	But then I sink
2589	2592	'Cause it's here I'm supposed to stay
2592	2595	But I get so lonely down here
2595	2599	Tell me, why's it have to be that way?
2600	2602	Up there, there is so much room
2603	2605	Where babies burp and flowers bloom
2605	2608	Everyone dreams, I can dream too
2609	2610	Up there
2610	2614	Up where the skies are ocean blue
2614	2617	I could be safe and live without a care
2618	2620	Up there
2621	2624	They say I don 't belong
2624	2626	I must stay below alone
2627	2629	Because of my beliefs
2629	2633	I'm supposed to stay where evil is sown
2634	2636	But what is evil anyway
2636	2638	Is there reason to the rhyme
2639	2641	Without evil there could be no good
2641	2645	So it must be good to be evil sometimes
2647	2649	Up there, there is so much room
2650	2652	Where babies burp and flowers bloom
2652	2655	Everyone dreams, I can dream too
2656	2656	Up there
2657	2660	Up where the skies are ocean blue
2661	2664	I could be safe and live without a care
2665	2668	Live without a care
2668	2671	If only I could live up there
2673	2675	I want to live, I want to live up
2680	2684	I want to live up there
2696	2698	-You're late! -l had to ride my bike here.
2698	2700	-My behind is killing me. -Your ''behind''?
2700	2703	l have to say ''behind'' because l get shocked if l say ''ass. ''
2703	2704	Did you bring the punch and pie?
2705	2707	No. You guys, something happened.
2707	2708	l don't think Kenny's dead.
2709	2710	l saw him in my room.
2711	2713	l know, Cartman. l see Kenny every day.
2713	2714	-You do? -Sure, dude.
2714	2717	On the face of every child, on the smile of every baby.
2718	2721	This was Kenny! He said that if Terrance and Phillip die. . .
2721	2725	. . .Saddam Hussein and Satan will come up and rule the world!
2725	2726	Saddam Hussein?
2731	2732	Who is it?
2732	2734	l'm here for La RÈsistance.
2734	2735	What's the password?
2735	2736	l don't know.
2736	2738	Guess.
2739	2740	Bacon.
2743	2745	Viva La RÈsistance !
2745	2746	Oh, no! lt's that kid!
2747	2748	This is the place.
2749	2751	Stan? You started La RÈsistance ?
2752	2754	You're more political than we thought.
2754	2757	Let us get this meeting underway. Many others are coming.
2760	2761	A lot of people showed up.
2764	2769	Terrance and Phillip are supposed to be killed, and we think that sucks ass!
2772	2774	We were to understand there'd be pie and punch.
2775	2776	There isn't any.
2780	2782	Terrance and Phillip are supposed to be killed. . .
2782	2785	. . .so we should prank call a bunch of policemen. . .
2785	2787	. . .and have pizzas sent to them that they didn't order.
2787	2789	Viva La RÈsistance !
2792	2794	-May l? -What?
2794	2798	Terrance and Phillip are being held in a camp two kilometers from town.
2798	2801	They are to be executed tomorrow during a star-studded USO show.
2801	2802	Tomorrow?
2802	2804	Once the show begins, we'll have an hour. . .
2804	2806	. . .to get them out of their cell and into this clearing.
2806	2810	There, we will rendezvous and take them back to Canada.
2810	2812	Dude, Wendy's new guy is smart.
2812	2814	Meet me at the rendezvous point at 1 0 p.m.
2814	2817	Sneaking in and breaking them out will be dangerous. . .
2817	2818	. . .so l'll go myself.
2820	2821	No! We're going!
2822	2825	We started La RÈsistance. We'll get them and meet at the rendezvous point.
2826	2828	This will be very dangerous. Are you quite sure?
2828	2829	Fuck that!
2829	2834	Do you want that V-chip in you forever? We'll go. Let's run through the plan.
2844	2849	Oh, boy! Military action, Ned! Let's kill us some goddamn Australians!
2849	2851	l think we're fighting Canadians.
2851	2853	Canadians, Australians, what's the difference?
2854	2858	This uniform makes me feel like a tough, brute man, Mr. Hat.
2858	2860	lt sure does, Mr. Garrison.
2860	2862	l can't wait for our first shore leave. . .
2862	2865	. . .so l can get me some fucking poon tang.
2866	2870	Pay attention! Tomorrow night is the USO show for all you troops.
2870	2873	There will be celebrities, followed by the execution of Terrance and Phillip.
2875	2879	After the show, we will finally be sending ground troops into Canada.
2880	2881	So let's strategize.
2881	2882	Map!
2883	2885	Our sources have told us that the Canadians. . .
2885	2888	. . .are preparing for our invasion, so we must use caution.
2888	2890	Each battalion has a specific code name and mission.
2891	2892	Battalion 5, raise your hands.
2893	2895	You will be the all-important first attack wave. . .
2896	2898	. . .which we will call ''Operation Human Shield. ''
2898	2899	Wait a minute!
2900	2903	Keep in mind Operation Human Shield will suffer heavy losses.
2903	2905	Battalion 1 4?
2905	2907	Right. You are Operation Get-Behind-the-Darkies.
2908	2911	You will follow Battalion 5. Try not to get killed, for God's sake.
2911	2913	Are there any questions?
2913	2914	Yes, soldier.
2914	2917	Have you ever heard of the Emancipation Proclamation?
2917	2919	l don't listen to hip-hop.
2919	2923	After that, we will march into the heart of Canada, and we will--
2923	2925	I'm gonna get you!
2925	2927	What's wrong with this thing?
2928	2929	lt's fucking Windows 98!
2929	2931	Get Bill Gates in here!
2934	2938	You told us Windows 98 would be faster, with better access to the lnternet!
2939	2940	lt is faster. Over 5 million--
2942	2944	All right, men, get lots of rest. . .
2944	2946	. . .and prepare to. . . .
2949	2952	After you have Terrance and Phillip, make your way to this ridge.
2952	2954	We will wait for you. But not for long.
2954	2956	So if you're not there at 1 0, we'll have to leave.
2957	2960	You're brave, but you'll need help from someone who's done this before.
2960	2962	Here's the address of ''The Mole. ''
2963	2967	He is an expert in covert operations. Your first task will be obtaining him.
2967	2971	Get lots of sleep. Tomorrow we will all be risking our lives for freedom.
2972	2975	God has smiled upon you this day
2976	2981	The fate of a nation in your hands
2981	2984	And blessed be the children here
2984	2986	Who fight with all our bravery
2987	2991	Till only the righteous stand
2992	2995	You see the distant flames They bellow in the night
2995	2998	You fight in all our names For what we know is right
2999	3001	And when you all get shot And cannot carry on
3002	3004	Though you die, La RÈsistance lives on
3005	3008	You may get stabbed in the head With a dagger or a sword
3008	3012	You may be burned to death Or skinned alive or worse
3012	3015	But when they torture you You will not feel the need to run
3015	3018	For though you die, La RÈsistance lives on
3018	3021	Blame Canada Blame Canada
3021	3024	Because the country's gone awry Tomorrow night these freaks will fry
3025	3028	Tomorrow night Our lives will change
3029	3031	Tomorrow night We'll be entertained
3032	3035	An execution, what a sight Tomorrow night
3036	3038	Up there, there's so much room Where babies burp and flowers bloom
3039	3042	Tomorrow night up there is doomed And so I will be going soon
3042	3044	Shut your fucking face Uncle fucker
3044	3047	You're a boner-biting bastard Uncle fucker
3048	3051	-Looks like we may be out of luck -Tomorrow night, we're pretty fucked
3051	3054	Why did our mothers start this war What the fuck are they fighting for
3054	3056	When did this song become a marathon
3057	3060	When Canada is dead and gone There'll be no more Celine Dion
3060	3063	They may cut your dick in half And serve it to a pig
3063	3066	And though it hurts, you'll laugh And dance a dickless jig
3066	3069	That's the way it goes In war you're shat upon
3069	3072	Though you die La RÈsistance lives on
3085	3089	l'm so excited. Just one more day until we can take over the world.
3089	3092	l don't know if l can sleep, if you know what l mean.
3092	3096	This book talks about how people communicate differently.
3096	3099	l communicate by wanting you to ask me questions, and you--
3099	3102	That is interesting. Let's fuck!
3102	3106	Saddam, l'm trying to have a nice conversation with you!
3107	3109	Now that is Just not appropriate!
3109	3112	Come on, l'm Just fucking with you! lt's not real!
3112	3115	-Well, that's still not appropriate. -Hey, daddy.
3116	3119	lt's not real, either! Come on, guy!
3125	3128	Soon the world will belong to me.
3131	3134	lt's Saddam. He doesn't nurture my emotions.
3134	3138	He Just wants sex and can't learn to communicate.
3139	3142	You're right. l should leave him. l'll tell him. . .
3142	3145	. . . ''Saddam, l'm going to Earth to rule alone! ''
3145	3148	l'm strong and l don't need him!
3152	3154	Today's the day for the USO show
3154	3156	We're so happy we get to go
3156	3158	I don 't know but I've been told
3158	3160	Canadian pussy is mighty cold
3160	3162	Stay in the attic, because if they find you. . .
3162	3164	. . .they'll put you in a concentration camp.
3166	3168	Don't worry. We'll put an end to this.
3168	3171	Then l'll make Mom come home, and we'll all be a family again.
3194	3196	We need to speak with The Mole.
3196	3200	l'm sorry. The Mole is grounded. He can't come out and play.
3200	3201	-What?! -He's a kid?
3201	3203	He said very naughty things about God.
3204	3206	Can we Just talk to him for five seconds?
3206	3209	Well, all right. Christophe!
3211	3214	We're gonna rescue Terrance and Phillip from the USO show--
3215	3216	Who sent you?
3216	3218	Gregory! He said you could sneak us in.
3218	3220	Are you telling me you intend to break into the USO show. . .
3220	3224	. . .filled with thousands of soldiers and break out Terrance and Phillip?
3224	3225	l thought it was a stupid idea too.
3226	3229	We're La RÈsistance. We wanna save Terrance and Phillip and stop the war.
3229	3232	l can't help you. l'm grounded for the next three days.
3232	3235	So are we. Our parents think we're home right now.
3235	3236	-Why are you grounded? -Why?
3236	3240	Because God hates me. He has made my life miserable.
3240	3242	So l call Him a cocksucking asshole, and l get grounded.
3243	3244	-So will you help us? -Very well.
3245	3247	Meet me in the backyard in five minutes. Viva La RÈsistance.
3248	3249	We'll show God that we won't fucking--
3250	3251	What? Christophe, get in here!
3251	3253	Coming, mother.
3254	3257	l must be strong. l must be strong.
3257	3259	Saddam, l need to talk to you.
3259	3263	Get packing, bitch. We have to go! We're running out of time!
3263	3267	Saddam, sometimes you can love a person very much. . .
3267	3269	. . .but still know they aren't right for you.
3269	3270	What are you talking about?
3271	3273	You treat me like shit! l'm leaving you!
3273	3275	l'm going up to Earth to rule alone.
3276	3278	No! No, you can't do that!
3278	3280	l'm sorry, but l have to be strong.
3281	3283	Give me another chance! l have to go to Earth!
3283	3285	You don't have respect for me!
3285	3287	Sure l do, guy. Please Just hear me out.
3291	3295	Some people say that I'm a bad guy
3295	3298	They may be right They may be right
3299	3302	But it's not as if I don 't try
3302	3305	I just fuck up, try as I might
3305	3307	But I can change, I can change
3308	3311	I can learn to keep my promises I swear it

3322	3324	I like to kill, I like to maim I'm insane, but it's okay
3324	3325	'Cause I can change
3327	3329	It's not my fault that I'm so evil
3329	3332	It's society, society
3333	3335	You see my parents Were sometimes abusive
3336	3338	And it made a prick of me
3338	3340	But I can change, I can change
3340	3343	What if you remain A sandy little butthole

3373	3375	You see, l've really matured.

3407	3409	God? He is the biggest bitch of them all.
3410	3412	Hurry. We rendezvous with the other kids at 1 0.
3414	3417	You realize we could be grounded for two, even three weeks.
3418	3420	-We're willing to take that risk. -Let's go.
3420	3424	And now, here are your hosts for the evening, Sheila Broflovski...

3438	3441	That's right, Sheila. Bring out the condemned.
3445	3448	Today is a great day for democracy!
3450	3455	This is worse than when you put your dick in my mouth and took a picture.
3455	3456	l know, Terrance. l know.
3456	3461	While you're getting set up over there, let's bring out our first act:

3491	3492	Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
3493	3495	Yes, but they are heavily guarded.
3495	3497	Dig from here, so as not to be seen.

3513	3516	Men, when you're out there in the battlefield. . .
3516	3518	. . .and you're looking into the beady eyes of a Canadian. . .
3518	3521	. . .as he charges you with his hockey stick or whatever he has. . .
3521	3526	. . .and people are dying all around you, Just remember what the MPAA says:
3526	3531	''Deplorable violence is okay as long as people don't say any naughty words. ''
3532	3535	That is what this war is all about.
3536	3537	What?
3539	3541	Shit!

3554	3557	TV kiddie hour where we sit around and lick Barney the Dinosaur's pussy?
