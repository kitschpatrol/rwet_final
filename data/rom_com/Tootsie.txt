61	64	That's right. Come on. No, don't stop.
69	70	Keep looking!
72	75	You don't feel so good now, do you?
76	78	See, you let it out. Out!
87	88	I feel like an idiot.
89	91	Not so fast, not so fast. Slower.
91	92	Slower.
93	95	Good, good.
96	98	Keep it specific.
98	100	Still a little tension in the mouth.
100	102	Good, good.
102	104	Okay, make her work peripherally.
110	111	Michael...
111	112	...Dorsey, is it?
113	114	Yes, that's right.
115	118	Mr. Dorsey, would you turn to page 23, please?
119	122	Yes, I believe you mean the first scene...
122	123	Sorry, the second scene of the first act.
124	127	Second scene of the first act. Right. Begin when you're ready.
127	128	Yes, of course.
134	138	Oh, sweetheart, do you know what it was like waking up in Paris...
138	140	...seeing the empty pillow where...
141	145	Wait! Cover your breasts. Kevin is downstairs! My God, what are you?
145	149	I'm a woman. Not Felicia's mother. Not Kevin's wife.
149	152	Thanks very much. We need someone a little older.
154	156	Mom! Dad! Uncle Pete, come quick!
156	159	Something's wrong with Biscuit! I think he's dead!
160	162	We're looking for someone younger.
162	166	"They have dinner..." Can I start again? I didn't get kicked off right.
167	169	The reading was fine. You're the wrong height.
169	170	I can be taller.
171	173	No. We're looking for somebody shorter.
174	176	Look. I don't have to be this tall.
176	179	See, I'm wearing lifts. I can be shorter.
180	183	I know, but we're looking for somebody different.
183	184	I can be different.
185	186	We're looking for somebody else.
187	189	What do you care more about than working?
190	193	The part's the most important thing. But love sometimes is too.
193	197	With improvisation, you're the writer. When somebody writes a play...
197	201	...they decide where the highs are, where the lows are. Now you do it.
201	204	And you may not be high where they're high in the writing.
204	206	You may not be low where they're low.
206	210	You may be high on "but." You may be high on "and."
210	212	Of course, they were doing it for dough...
212	214	...the same as everybody does it for dough.
215	217	But the question is in the last analysis.
217	220	What were they doing for dough?
220	224	You and me were advancing our little non-Prussian careers.
224	228	So when all hell broke loose, and the Germans ran out of soap...
228	232	...and figured, "What the hell? Let's cook up Mrs. Greenwald!"...
233	235	...who the hell do you think stopped them?
241	244	Pardon me, is my acting interfering with your talking?
244	246	Don't play a part that's not in you.
247	251	Don't say "he" or "she" like you did last week when you were doing Kitty.
251	253	When you were doing Time Of Your Life.
253	256	If you can't make the part yourself, you can't play it.
257	257	Sergeant.
258	259	Quick! Get a priest!
260	261	No, sergeant, no priest.
261	263	- But you're dying, Count Tolstoy. - I know.
263	266	In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost...
266	268	...I commit your soul to God.
270	272	- My friends... - That's super, Michael.
272	277	But I wonder if you could move center stage on that speech, and then die.
279	280	Why?
280	282	The left side of the house can't see you.
286	291	You want me to stand up and walk to the center of the stage...
291	292	...while I'm dying?
293	296	I know it's awkward, but we'll just have to do it.
296	299	- Why? - I just told you. Now do it!
300	301	Because you say so?
301	303	Yes, love.
304	306	Not with me as Tolstoy.
307	308	You gotta work.
309	311	There's no excuse for not working.
311	313	There's no excuse. There's unemployment.
313	317	There was unemployment when my friends and I started acting.
317	318	And it's not changed.
319	322	You got 90-95% unemployment. It's never going to change.
322	324	You're an actor. You're in New York.
324	328	There is no work. But you gotta find ways to work.
328	331	Two tortellinis, a gazpacho with two salads.
331	335	Ordering: Veal chop, medium, two scrods, an order of chicken!
335	336	One scrod underdone.
337	339	- What's the rest? - Baked potato.
339	341	- How'd it go? - Terrible.
341	343	- Did you rewrite the last scene? - I did the necktie scene.
344	345	How is it?
345	347	It'll change theatre as we know it.
347	350	We'll work on it when we get home tonight.
350	351	That's my flounder.
351	353	- That is my flounder. - Robber!
353	356	- Ordering: One flounder... - That's for the customer!
356	360	I eat these things so if the customers ask if I eat his food...
360	363	...I can say, "Yeah, I eat his food."
365	367	You rewrote the necktie scene? Good.
367	369	- Without the necktie? - With the necktie.
370	372	- With the necktie? - Yeah, with the necktie.
372	376	The necktie's wrong. You take the necktie out, you got something.
377	379	- What's wrong with you? - What's wrong with me?
379	382	What's wrong is it's depressing to be disagreed with.
382	384	It's depression.
384	387	Today's your birthday, and you haven't mentioned it.
388	391	Don't start. I'm a character actor. Age has no effect on me.
392	395	- That's very good. - How does one not be depressed?
395	399	Instead of trying to be Michael Dorsey, the great actor or the great waiter...
399	401	...why not just try to be Michael Dorsey?
402	404	I am Michael Dorsey. What's the payoff?
404	408	- Say it like you mean it. - I am Michael Dorsey. Fine. Okay?
408	410	Surprise!
417	419	Speech! Speech! Speech!
419	422	Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait a minute.
422	423	First a toast.
423	427	To Michael Dorsey, who makes you remember what acting's all about!
428	429	Being unemployed!
431	432	To Michael...
432	434	...who's been my friend for six years.
435	436	Was it that long?
436	439	And who is my coach. And he's just great.
439	442	He's a great coach, a great actor. He's a great guy and...
443	445	This is a really dumb speech. Let's get drunk.
445	447	Happy birthday!
469	471	- How you doing? Michael. - Patty.
471	475	You an actress? Terrific face. Nice blouse. Who'd you come with?
475	478	I don't want a full house at the Winter Garden Theatre.
479	483	I want 90 people who just came out of the worst rainstorm in history.
483	487	These are people who are alive on the planet...
488	489	...until they dry off.
490	493	I wish I had a theatre that was only open when it rained.
496	498	Strasberg said you create your opportunities.
499	500	- Uta said that. - I don't care.
500	505	The point is, Sandy and I are raising $8,000 to do Jeff's play in Syracuse.
505	508	We're going to do it. You could do the same.
509	511	Look at Emily! Look who's here.
512	513	You can do it in the Poconos.
513	517	You're sitting around saying, "I can't work." Create your own...
517	518	Isn't she cute?
519	521	He loves children. He really does.
521	524	You make it! You find a way to raise it.
524	527	I was looking at you. Terrific face. Are you an actress?
528	530	- Sometimes. - You were in Dames At Sea!
530	532	- You saw that? - Good work. Really!
533	535	You have a great singing voice.
535	538	I felt there was an aura between us when I saw it.
538	540	I'm not kidding. I don't know you, but I know you.
540	543	I'll tell you about yourself. You like to run barefoot on the beach.
544	547	- Why are you so wired? - It's my birthday. I'm out of work.
548	549	That's it? Nothing more?
549	553	Yeah, it hurts me. Be the last one to take your coat tonight. We'll talk.
553	555	Fine. All right.
555	556	Will you? Serious?
556	557	Give me a hug.
558	559	Thank you for liking me.
560	562	I don't like it when people say...
563	565	..."I really dug your message, man."
565	568	Or, "I really dug your play, man. I cried."
569	570	You know?
571	573	I like it when people come up to me...
573	574	...the next day...
575	577	...or a week later and they say...
577	578	..."I saw your play.
580	581	What happened?"
581	585	I've got it under control. I'll feed my cats and be back in an hour.
585	588	I can't make it. My roommate wants to work on the third act.
588	591	- You can't make it? - He wants to work.
591	593	- Give me your phone number. - I already did.
594	596	- I thought you changed it. - Since an hour ago?
597	600	Good point. Let me talk to him. I'll call you.
602	604	- Didn't anybody hear me? - Guess not.
605	607	I've been trapped for half an hour.
607	608	What kind of a party is this?
608	611	God, you guys are having a good time, huh?
611	612	Sorry.
613	616	I'll remember that if I ever do a scene where I'm trapped.
617	619	- It's nice, Michael. - Thanks.
621	622	Who is that?
622	625	- Mallory. She's married to John. - Oh, yeah.
630	634	I did a thing about suicides of the American Indian.
635	637	And nobody cared. Nobody showed.
638	642	And I think the American Indian is as American...
642	644	...as John and Ethel Barrymore...
645	646	...and Donny and Marie Osmond.
647	648	I think it's really sad...
649	652	...but I think that, nowadays, when people dream...
652	655	...they don't even dream in their own country anymore.
656	657	And that's sick.
657	659	I had a good time. I just didn't know half the people.
660	662	It was late, and I wanted it to be a surprise.
662	665	I invited 10 people. They all invited 10 people.
665	667	You met 40 new people. They all liked you.
668	669	I heard nice things about you.
669	671	- Thanks, Jeff. - Good night.
671	673	- Happy birthday. - Thank you.
673	675	- One of the five people I knew. - Great party.
675	676	Thank you.
680	683	Excuse me, Miss Right? Miss Right?
691	692	Good night. It was a wonderful party.
693	697	My date left with someone else. I had fun. Do you have any Seconal?
697	699	Come on, I'll take you home.
700	702	I did have a good time. I really did.
703	705	You didn't. Wait. Money for cab fare.
705	707	That's okay. It's cheaper to get mugged. Let's walk.
708	710	The fares are really insane now anyway.
710	713	- Why didn't you have a good time? - I did have a good time.
714	715	- What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong.
716	717	What?
717	721	- What? - Nothing! I'm perfectly fine.
721	723	I just cry like this, like a tic.
723	726	Tell me what's wrong, or I'll kill you.
726	729	Nothing's wrong, Michael. I'm really very up.
729	733	You're worried about your audition. Why?
733	735	- Because I'm not going to get it. - Why not?
735	739	- Because I'm completely wrong for it. - What kind of a part is it?
740	741	A woman!
742	744	You don't have a man, so you act like one.
744	747	You're wrong, Dr. Brewster. I'm proud of being a woman.
747	749	Wait a minute. This guy treats you like dirt...
750	751	...because he's a big doctor, right?
752	754	But don't take that. Talk to him on his level.
755	755	Show me.
756	758	You're doing a Southern accent?
758	760	You're wrong, Dr. Brewster. I'm very proud of being a woman!
761	763	I can't do it as good as you.
763	766	You can! Just turn the tables on him. Come on, now.
767	769	You're wrong. I'm proud of being a woman.
769	770	Where am I off?
770	774	- I don't know what you're playing. - I'm playing rage. I'm enraged.
775	777	You told me to turn the tables. I'm playing rage.
777	778	This is rage?
780	781	I have a problem with anger.
782	785	You do. But there's 100 other actresses reading...
785	787	...who don't, who aren't afraid of working.
787	789	Who aren't afraid to stick everything on the line and do it!
790	792	- Don't get mad! - Stop being a doormat!
792	795	- I'm not a doormat! - Act right now! Do it!
795	797	You're wrong, Dr. Brewster. I am...
797	798	Go on.
798	801	- You're wrong, Dr. Brewster... - Must I hit you with a stick?
801	804	You're wrong. I am very proud to be a woman.
804	805	And I'm proud of this hospital.
806	808	And before I see it destroyed by your petty tyrannies...
808	809	Have the anger. Don't show it to me.
810	812	...I'll recommend you be thrown out into the street.
812	814	- Don't lose it. - Good day.
814	817	- Don't whine like you're second-rate. - I said good day!
819	820	Not bad.
820	821	Did you feel how much I hated you?
822	824	- You really felt it? - That's why I'm going.
824	828	How can I get it back tomorrow? How can a total stranger enrage me?
828	830	I'll pick you up at 10:00 and enrage you.
836	839	Bruce Fortune to Telecine. Bruce Fortune to Telecine.
839	841	- Bennett? - Right here.
841	842	Stanz?
848	849	I'm supposed to look like this?
849	851	- That is what you look like. - It's not funny.
851	852	Good. Don't lose that.
852	855	No sequins, Alfred. She's attending her husband's funeral.
856	859	Jacqui? As soon as Ron gets here, in.
859	860	Lester.
860	862	Lester. Sandy Lester?
862	863	Yes, here.
865	866	Stop it!
868	870	Bye-bye. Good morning, ladies.
870	873	Please bring your résumés and follow me.
873	874	Wish me luck.
874	876	- Fuck you. - Thank you.
876	877	- Go. - God bless you.
878	882	Here you'll recognize your favorite characters from Southwest General...
883	886	...including John Van Horn, who has played Dr. Medford Brewster...
886	889	...since the first episode aired 20 years ago.
889	894	Now we'll head into Studio B, where the episodes are actually taped.
896	899	Andrew Donovan, report to Wardrobe, please.
899	900	I didn't get it.
900	902	- What? - They wouldn't let me read.
903	907	- They wouldn't let you read? - They said I wasn't right physically.
907	910	They want somebody tougher. So I'm going home.
910	911	I'll walk you.
911	912	To San Diego?
912	915	- What are you talking about? - I'm going home!
915	916	I hate it here!
917	920	God! I'm 34! I paid $24 for these glasses.
920	922	All I do is buy things... I want to be a waitress.
922	925	I wasn't gonna resort to this, but you're gonna read.
926	928	Excuse me, is Terry Bishop here?
928	931	No, Mr. Bishop is rehearsing The Iceman Cometh for Broadway.
932	932	He's what?
933	936	He's rehearsing The Iceman Cometh for Broadway.
936	938	That was my part. I was supposed to be up...
939	942	I got to see somebody. Don't do anything rash.
943	944	Will he be back?
966	967	- Is George Fields in? - Yes, he is.
968	970	Now, wait a minute. You can't just go in there!
978	981	Michael, he's tied up right now. I swear!
982	985	Hang on. Will you wait outside? I'm talking to the Coast.
985	987	This is a coast. New York is a coast too.
988	989	Oh, boy.
989	990	Sy, are you...
991	993	God... Look what you... Margaret?
993	995	Get him back. I cut myself off.
995	996	What is it, Michael?
997	1001	Terry Bishop's doing Iceman. You promised to send me up for that.
1001	1004	You told me I'd get a reading for that. Aren't you my agent?
1004	1007	- Stuart Pressman wants a name. - Terry Bishop is a name?
1007	1011	Michael Dorsey is a name, when you want to send a steak back.
1011	1014	Wait, wait, wait! You always do this to me.
1014	1017	It was a rotten thing to say. Let me start again.
1017	1020	Terry Bishop is on a soap. Millions watch him every day.
1020	1024	That qualifies him to ruin Iceman? I can act circles around him.
1024	1028	- I played that part in Minneapolis. - lf he wants a name, that's his affair.
1029	1032	People are in this business to make money.
1032	1034	- I'm in it to make money too. - Really?
1034	1038	The Harlem Theatre for the Blind? The People's Workshop at Syracuse?
1038	1040	Wait a minute. I did nine plays up at Syracuse.
1040	1044	I got great reviews from the critics. Not that that's why I did it.
1044	1047	God forbid you should lose your standing as a cult failure.
1047	1049	You think I'm a failure?
1049	1051	I will not get sucked into this conversation.
1052	1053	I will not.
1053	1057	I sent you my roommate's play to read. It had a great part in it for me.
1057	1060	Where do you come off sending me a play for you to star in?
1060	1063	I'm not your mother. I don't find plays for you to star in.
1064	1065	I field offers. That's what I do.
1065	1067	Who told you that? The agent fairy?
1068	1070	I could be terrific in that part.
1070	1072	- Nobody's going to do that play. - Why?
1073	1076	It's a downer about a couple that move back to Love Canal.
1076	1077	But that actually happened.
1077	1080	Nobody wants to watch people living next to chemical waste!
1081	1082	They can see that in Jersey.
1083	1086	I don't want to argue about it. I'll raise $8,000 and produce his play.
1087	1088	Send me up for anything. I don't care.
1089	1092	I'll do dog commercials. I'll do radio voice-overs.
1092	1094	- I can't put you up for that. - Why not?
1094	1097	Because no one will hire you.
1097	1099	I bust my ass to get a part right!
1100	1102	And you bust everybody else's ass too!
1102	1105	Who wants to argue about whether Tolstoy can...
1105	1108	...walk when he's dying or walk when he's talking..?
1108	1111	That was two years ago, and that guy's an idiot!
1111	1114	They can't all be idiots. You argue with everybody!
1114	1117	You've got one of the worst reputations in this town.
1118	1120	Nobody will hire you.
1121	1124	Are you saying that nobody in New York will work with me?
1124	1128	Nobody in Hollywood will either. I can't even get you a commercial.
1128	1132	You played a tomato, and they went over schedule because you wouldn't sit.
1133	1134	Yes, it wasn't logical.
1134	1138	You were a tomato! A tomato doesn't have logic. It can't move!
1138	1141	So if he can't move, how's he going to sit down?
1141	1144	I was a stand-up tomato. A juicy, sexy, beefsteak tomato!
1145	1147	Nobody does vegetables like me! I did vegetables off-Broadway!
1148	1149	I did the best tomato, the best cucumber!
1150	1153	I did an endive salad that knocked the critics on their ass!
1155	1156	I'm trying to stay calm here.
1157	1159	You are a wonderful actor.
1159	1160	Thank you.
1160	1163	But you're too much trouble.
1163	1165	Get some therapy.
1166	1169	Okay, thanks. I'm gonna raise $8,000 to do Jeff's play.
1169	1172	Michael, you're not gonna raise 25 cents.
1173	1175	No one will hire you.
1176	1177	Oh, yeah?
1206	1207	Dorothy Michaels?
1207	1209	- Yes. - George Fields is your agent?
1209	1211	- Yes. - Okay, ladies.
1211	1213	Please bring your pages and follow me.
1217	1220	I hate this line, "You have every right to happiness."
1220	1222	This is Dorothy Michaels. Our director, Ron Carlysle.
1222	1227	That's our producer, Rita Marshall. George Fields is Dorothy's agent.
1227	1228	That's impressive.
1231	1235	I'm afraid you're not right for this role. Thanks for coming by.
1235	1237	Page 205, you want camera one or two?
1237	1240	- Camera two, and tell Art. - Why am I not right?
1241	1243	I'm trying to make a certain statement...
1244	1246	...and I'm looking for a specific physical type.
1247	1251	Mr. Carlysle, I'm a character actress. I can play it any way you want.
1252	1254	I'm sure you're a very good actress.
1254	1257	It's just that you're not threatening enough.
1257	1258	Not threatening enough?
1258	1261	Take your hands off me or I'll knee you in the balls!
1262	1264	- Is that enough of a threat? - It's a start.
1264	1268	I think I know what you want. You want a caricature of a woman.
1268	1272	To prove some point like power makes a woman masculine...
1272	1273	...or masculine women are ugly.
1274	1277	Well, shame on any woman that lets you do that.
1277	1279	And that means you, Miss Marshall.
1279	1282	Shame on you, you macho shithead.
1283	1284	Jesus!
1286	1290	What is idiotic about power making a woman masculine?
1292	1293	Not that that was my point.
1296	1298	Miss Michaels, just a minute.
1300	1302	Was that for real or were you auditioning?
1302	1305	Which answer will get me a reading, Miss Marshall?
1305	1307	Well, good for you.
1307	1308	Come.
1309	1312	- Miss Michaels. - Yes. Oh, thank you.
1315	1317	You really think she's worth testing?
1317	1322	She told me no director had ever communicated a part to her so fast.
1322	1323	She said that?
1325	1326	I like her...
1326	1327	...accent.
1338	1341	- I gotta get these back in order. - They won't know the difference.
1347	1349	I'm a little nervous.
1350	1351	Just think of them as something friendly.
1352	1353	Like a firing squad.
1358	1361	Miss Michaels, we're going to do a camera test now.
1362	1366	Let me have a right profile, camera 1. Camera 3, a left profile.
1366	1367	What side?
1367	1368	Left side.
1368	1370	Which way for your left?
1371	1373	- What? - Is that my left or your left?
1373	1376	Wait. What are you talking about? My left.
1376	1377	Your left.
1377	1380	Miss Michaels, nobody's talking to you.
1380	1382	I'm sorry. I thought you wanted my profile.
1383	1385	- Not so close on camera 3. - Camera 3, back off.
1387	1389	Make her look a little more attractive. How far can you pull back?
1389	1391	- How do you feel about Cleveland? - Knock it off.
1391	1393	That's good right there, Herbie.
1394	1397	Dorothy, honey, we're going to try one. Okay?
1397	1400	Let me see exactly what you showed us a while ago.
1400	1401	Cue her, Jo.
1402	1405	"I know the kind of woman you are, Emily.
1405	1409	You're getting older. You don't have a man, so you want to act like one."
1410	1413	Shut your mouth right now. When you talk to me, talk professionally.
1414	1417	You don't get personal. That is inappropriate behavior.
1418	1420	I'm proud of being a woman, Dr. Brewster.
1420	1422	I'm proud of this hospital, and you should be too.
1423	1428	And I must tell you, before I let it be destroyed by your petty tyrannies...
1428	1431	...by your callous inhumanities, sir...
1431	1434	...I'm going to recommend you be turned out into the street.
1437	1438	Good day, Dr. Brewster.
1440	1442	I said good day, sir.
1447	1449	Thank you. Hold it a minute.
1450	1451	Tough cookie.
1451	1452	I gave her that direction.
1453	1454	Something more, though.
1454	1459	I don't know. It's your decision, but something about her bothers me.
1460	1461	I like it.
1461	1464	We'll send the contracts to George.
1470	1474	Excuse me. Could you help me? I'm looking for the Russian Tea Room.
1475	1478	This is the Russian Tea Room. You're in front of it.
1479	1480	Oh, well, my stars! So it is.
1481	1483	Well, this is very embarrassing.
1483	1485	Yeah, well, this is it.
1485	1487	Thanks very much.
1493	1497	Good afternoon, Mr. Fields. Nice to see you. Please sit down.
1500	1502	- The waiter will be just a minute. - George, how are you?
1503	1505	Hey, Ronnie. How are you?
1512	1514	- Hi. - Wait a minute...
1514	1517	I'm new in town, and I'm lonely. Would you buy me lunch?
1518	1520	You can't come... Gregory, this woman...
1520	1521	Don't. It's okay.
1521	1525	George. George. George. It's Michael Dorsey, okay?
1525	1529	Your favorite client. How are you? Last job you got me was a tomato.
1530	1531	- Oh, no, no, no... - Yeah.
1532	1534	- Swear to God. - Michael?
1534	1537	Oh, God! I begged you to get therapy.
1537	1541	- You also said no one would hire me. - And this'll make a difference?
1542	1543	I got a soap.
1543	1546	I'm the new woman administrator on Southwest General.
1546	1549	Congratulate me! They thought I almost looked too feminine.
1550	1553	- Something from the bar? - A double vodka right away, please.
1554	1555	For the lady?
1556	1558	How about a Dubonnet with a twist?
1558	1560	- Thank you. Lovely blouse. - Thank you.
1560	1563	- Welcome. - You won't get away with this.
1563	1565	- I got away with it. Look around. - I don't believe this.
1566	1569	I mean, I just don't believe anybody else will.
1569	1571	- You want to bet? - Don't sit...
1572	1575	- You know Joel Spector. - Hello, Joel. How are you?
1576	1578	I talked to Stuart yesterday.
1578	1582	He'll be one more week in London. Then he definitely...
1582	1584	- I missed you! - Then he definitely...
1584	1589	You're such a tickly-wickly. You never were before. We go back years.
1590	1592	- We haven't been introduced. - Joel Spector.
1592	1593	- I'm sorry. - Phil Weintraub.
1594	1597	- Sorry. This is Michael... - Dorothy Michaels. Nice to meet you.
1597	1600	May I say that you are the best director...
1601	1602	- Producer. - Sorry. Producer...
1602	1604	...on the Broadway scene today.
1604	1606	Thank you. Thank you, Miss Michaels.
1608	1610	- Hope to see you again. - Let's have lunch.
1610	1612	- Fine. - Call you.
1612	1614	He's handsome. You should represent him.
1614	1616	- You are psychotic! - No, I'm employed.
1616	1618	- I got the whole world... - Don't!
1619	1622	- I won't make fun of you. - Don't get close to me!
1622	1624	- Loan me $1000 till payday. - For what?
1625	1628	For what? I gotta have something to wear besides this.
1644	1647	I won't let you not buy it. It's the best dress you've had on.
1648	1649	I think it makes me look dumpy.
1650	1653	Because you're wearing ankle straps. With a few alterations...
1654	1656	Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!
1656	1658	Thank you, thank you.
1659	1661	What are you doing? I was here first!
1672	1673	Thank you.
1673	1676	Those women were like animals. I saw this beautiful handbag.
1676	1680	I was afraid to fight for it. They're vicious. They kill their own.
1681	1684	The woman that finally bought this handbag, I know did time.
1685	1687	Now I don't have a decent handbag.
1687	1689	You know what this lingerie cost? And the makeup?
1689	1692	How does a woman keep herself attractive and not starve?
1692	1694	Can I have more cottage cheese?
1694	1697	- You wore this today? - I gotta set that before I go to bed.
1697	1698	Easy, easy, easy. Please!
1698	1700	I'm dieting. Please.
1700	1703	I gotta get up at 4:30, do a close shave.
1703	1706	I told the studio I do my own makeup because I'm allergic.
1706	1710	I appreciate your doing this, but it's for the money, isn't it?
1710	1713	It's not so you can wear these little outfits?
1713	1717	I'm not even gonna answer that. It's a great acting challenge.
1718	1720	You know what my problem is?
1721	1721	Cramps.
1722	1724	No, not cramps.
1724	1725	Sandy.
1726	1730	How can I tell her they cast a man instead of her? She'll be suicidal.
1730	1731	Don't tell her.
1731	1733	Where will I say I got the money?
1734	1737	What am I going to do? Tell her somebody died and left it to me?
1737	1739	- My God! When did she die? - Last week.
1740	1741	Of what?
1741	1742	A disease.
1742	1745	Gee, what a coincidence.
1745	1749	I mean, your needing $8000 and her leaving you exactly that much.
1749	1751	- Isn't it? - It's, well...
1751	1752	- All right, kid. - It's mine?
1753	1755	- Learn your lines. - I'm excited!
1755	1757	This is the greatest part!
1757	1760	I want to take you to dinner. It's time we celebrated something.
1760	1763	- To Return to the Love Canal. - Hurry up.
1764	1766	- I'll jump in the shower. - Hurry, hurry, hurry!
1779	1781	Why, yes.
1812	1815	You know, we can stay here if you want to, and...
1815	1818	- What are you doing? - Oh, God! I'm...
1822	1824	Sandy, I want you.
1824	1825	You want me?
1825	1827	I want you.
1828	1829	I want you.
1832	1836	- Will I ever see you again? - We've known each other six years.
1836	1839	I know. But sex changes things.
1840	1842	I've had relationships where I know a guy, then have sex with him...
1842	1845	...and then I bump into him and he acts like I loaned him money.
1846	1848	That's not me. I'll call you tomorrow.
1848	1852	I know there's pain in every relationship. I just want my pain now.
1853	1855	Otherwise, I'll wait by the phone...
1855	1857	...and then I'll have pain and wait by the phone.
1857	1858	It's a waste of time.
1859	1861	Let's make it definite. Dinner tomorrow.
1921	1922	Mom?
1925	1928	What do you think? Hurry. I'm late.
1928	1929	Turn around.
1932	1933	Smile.
1934	1936	- Say something. - Hello. It's nice to meet you.
1937	1938	You look very nice. Nice.
1938	1940	But the hair's not right.
1940	1943	You got a Howard Johnson's thing going.
1943	1946	Do something. I can't be late my first day. Come on.
1947	1950	- Easy, easy! - It's not your head.
1950	1952	- Okay? - Let's see.
1952	1954	Well, it works.
1955	1956	But what?
1957	1958	Don't play hard to get.
1961	1962	Taxi! Taxi!
1962	1963	Taxi!
1973	1975	- Dorothy Michaels. Southwest General. - Oh, yeah.
1975	1977	TV 2. Straight ahead, first right.
1977	1978	Is that clock right?
1979	1980	- Yes. - I couldn't get a cab.
1981	1983	Hi, Bobby. This is Miss Michaels.
1984	1988	You'll be in Room 4. We'll need you on set in about 15 minutes.
1989	1990	- I'm sorry. - That's ok...
1990	1992	- Oh, Jesus. - It's quite all right.
1993	1996	- I'm April Paige. - My, what a nice-looking table.
1996	1998	- Really? - Yes, it's very smooth.
1998	2001	And that's a very good idea. A socket for a plug.
2001	2004	- Yeah, well, we got everything. - Yes, I see.
2004	2008	Just push all that out of the way. Make yourself at home.
2011	2012	Yes?
2012	2015	One more thing, Miss Michaels. I forgot to give you these.
2015	2017	Oh, are these for today?
2017	2020	They always throw stuff at you in the last minute.
2021	2022	- My goodness! - What's wrong?
2022	2025	- I have to kiss Dr. Brewster! - He kisses all the women.
2026	2028	We call him "The Tongue."
2029	2033	Okay, quickly. Now, the tubes have pulled out of Rick's nose.
2034	2036	Julie, there's an alert at your station.
2036	2039	Rick, get on the floor. That's why the tubes pulled out.
2039	2042	When Julie starts stuffing the tubes back up your nose...
2042	2045	...you grab her hard. - In his condition?
2045	2048	Yes. He's been crazy since he fell through the ice.
2048	2050	You're delirious. You think she's Anthea.
2050	2052	- Mr. Carlysle, I... - Jesus Christ!
2053	2055	Could I have a little more hammering here?!
2058	2062	Now, when you grab her, maybe you even say, "Anthea! Anthea!"
2062	2064	Good. Is my violin somewhere in the room?
2065	2067	Your violin sunk. It's at the bottom of the lake.
2069	2070	The violin fell through the ice.
2071	2073	He was playing during the thaw.
2073	2075	You're Dorothy Michaels, aren't you?
2076	2078	I'm John Van Horn.
2078	2080	We're up next.
2085	2088	When he grabs you, you've got to be torn, to struggle.
2088	2092	You know you've got to get those tubes stuck back up his nose.
2092	2094	But you also realize you're in the arms of a man...
2095	2099	...whose music was everything to Anthea. It was her whole life.
2099	2102	This is a man who stood by you after Ted's breakdown.
2102	2104	Get me a bagel and cream cheese.
2105	2107	- Julie, you want anything? - No. She's fine, thanks.
2108	2112	So it's a struggle, but you're struggling with yourself as well.
2112	2115	- And I lose, right? - Get down here a minute.
2115	2118	Now, then, Rick, it says when she comes down to her knees...
2119	2121	...it inflames your desire.
2121	2122	God knows, it inflames mine.
2123	2124	Okay, Big John.
2125	2127	Dorothy, come in here.
2127	2130	This is Dorothy Michaels, the new hospital administrator.
2130	2132	Hello, Dorothy.
2132	2135	Hi! We met the other day. Julie Nichols, hospital slut.
2136	2137	No! Now, Mr. Carlysle...
2137	2140	I'm sorry, but we have so little time, we can't even rehearse.
2141	2145	I'm gonna show you your marks, and then we'll go straight to tape.
2145	2148	Big John, you'll enter from here, you see them struggling...
2149	2152	...you cross to here and cry loudly, "Nurse Charles! Are you insane?"
2153	2156	Yes, I see. Will it be on the teleprompter? "Loudly?"
2156	2158	And who do I say that to?
2159	2161	Nurse Charles.
2161	2163	I thought when Dr. Brewster...
2163	2166	You will enter from here, cross to this mark.
2166	2168	I know my mark. But I thought...
2168	2172	The corridor scene will be played right here. Right?
2172	2174	See, I just wanted to ask concerning the doctor...
2175	2177	Places, please. Stand by, tape is rolling.
2179	2182	Five, four, three...
2184	2185	Anthea!
2186	2187	Oh, Anthea!
2187	2188	Freeze up. One twenty-five.
2192	2194	Nurse Charles! Are you insane?
2194	2197	I'm Emily Kimberly, the new hospital administrator.
2198	2201	Nurse Charles, what on earth is going on here, dear?
2202	2204	Help me get her to her feet, Miss Kimberly.
2204	2206	John's going.
2208	2211	Nurse Charles, tend to your patient and faint on your own time!
2212	2213	- Yes, Miss... - Kimberly.
2214	2214	Dr. Brewster...
2215	2216	...you and I must talk.
2217	2220	- Rita, you want to keep rolling? - It's okay. The girl saved it.
2220	2223	- You haven't changed, Emily. - But I have, Medford.
2224	2228	You know, Emily, there's no reason for us to be in opposite camps.
2228	2230	We can rule Southwest General together.
2231	2233	I admire people with power.
2234	2236	Women with power, especially.
2238	2241	God, she hit him on the head. Rita, she hit him.
2241	2243	- and not consider it a threat?
2243	2246	I'm afraid that you have underestimated me.
2246	2249	If you want to win me over, you'll deal with my mind...
2249	2250	...and not my lips.
2251	2252	- Cut it. - And stop tape.
2252	2255	- I was supposed to kiss her. - It was just an instinct.
2255	2258	Remember what you said about being more threatening?
2259	2261	It was a good instinct. It would've been mine.
2261	2263	Wait. I'll handle the instincts here.
2263	2266	It happened to be a good instinct, toots.
2266	2270	But next time you want to change something, discuss it with me first.
2272	2273	Yes. I was wrong not to.
2274	2275	Good girl.
2275	2276	Big John, wonderful!
2276	2277	All right, people.
2278	2280	Item seven. In the corridor.
2281	2282	Thanks for catching me.
2283	2285	You saved my ass. Literally.
2286	2288	Dorothy...
2288	2292	...I just want to say I loved what you did in our scene. Welcome aboard!
2292	2294	Well, you know, you were good too...
2304	2306	Can I have your autograph? I've always watched the show.
2307	2308	You're so great.
2308	2310	Wonderful! Oh, thank you!
2310	2312	Thank you. That was an exhilarating first day.
2312	2315	- Tell me about it next week. - Good night.
2315	2316	Julie, come on, baby.
2317	2320	Can we drop you? Maybe you'd like to join us for a drink.
2321	2323	- No, thanks. I feel like walking. - Okay, bye.
2335	2337	She's a very attractive girl.
2338	2340	And no dummy. But for the life of me...
2340	2343	...I cannot understand why she hangs around with that director.
2344	2345	He treats her like she's just...
2346	2347	...nothing!
2347	2348	I think you're right.
2348	2351	I'm rewriting the necktie scene without the necktie.
2351	2354	He's condescending. He calls me "sweetheart."
2354	2355	He doesn't even know my name.
2356	2357	He calls her "baby."
2358	2361	He pushed me around. If not for the dress, I'd have kicked his ass.
2362	2364	How'd you communicate with him?
2364	2367	He told me what he wanted. I didn't say anything.
2367	2371	I did it my way. He bawled me out. I apologized. That was that.
2373	2375	I think Dorothy's smarter than I am.
2376	2379	I just wish I looked prettier. I look in the mirror and...
2379	2381	Maybe I can just get a softer...
2382	2384	...hair or something, because she deserves it.
2386	2388	- Don't answer that! - Why not?
2388	2392	- It could be for Dorothy. Please. - Why'd you give them this number?
2392	2395	The show has to contact me in case they change the schedule.
2395	2397	I'll find out.
2397	2400	They can't think Dorothy lives with a man! It's wrong for her.
2400	2402	It could be for me. Answer as Dorothy.
2403	2405	I can't! What if it's Sandy?
2405	2407	If it's Diane, how do I explain there's a woman here?
2407	2409	I'll get a service tomorrow.
2411	2415	When you were playing Cyrano and you stuck a saber in my armpit...
2416	2417	...I didn't say anything.
2417	2420	When you were hopping around, ranting about your hump...
2420	2423	...saying this was a bell tower, I didn't say anything.
2423	2426	But I don't see why I should pretend I'm not home...
2426	2428	...just because you're not that kind of girl.
2429	2430	That's weird.
2431	2433	- Where are you going? - To Diane's.
2433	2437	That way if anybody wants to reach me, they can talk to me.
2438	2442	What do you think I'm doing this for? For you, for the play, for Sandy...
2444	2447	I told you to give me the pain yesterday.
2447	2449	Sandy, I'm sorry. I can't talk long.
2450	2452	I just don't have the energy.
2452	2454	I didn't forget. I just may have the flu.
2454	2456	Do you have a fever?
2456	2459	How much? Go right to bed and take two aspirin...
2459	2461	...bundle up, sweat, and drink liquids.
2462	2465	Above all, take 1000 units of vitamin C every hour with milk only.
2489	2491	Did you give Melanie an overdose on purpose?
2492	2494	I don't know. I don't write the shit, you know.
2495	2498	Don't be so hard on Dr. Brewster. He's insecure.
2499	2501	I have to be tough. He just wants my body.
2502	2503	Dorothy, you're so bad.
2503	2508	- You look just the way you look. - Thank you. You're very attractive too.
2509	2510	I want you to meet my dad, Les.
2510	2513	- It's nice to meet you. - I feel I know you already.
2513	2516	I just love your daughter to pieces.
2527	2531	I can't write any clearer than I can write. It's in English.
2531	2533	- What about those? - For Sandy?
2533	2536	For me, for Dorothy. Not exactly, but that kind of idea.
2537	2539	- A little overstated. - Really? Wait a minute!
2539	2540	Jesus!
2541	2543	- That's her. - Mr. Earl!
2550	2552	You got it. Thursday, what time?
2554	2556	8:30.
2556	2558	I will not forget. Okay, bye-bye.
2569	2572	"Things are better since you came to Southwest General."
2573	2574	- "We're so grateful to you." - For?
2574	2579	- "For your help and advice." - "I think of you all as my daughters."
2580	2583	"What kind of mother wouldn't give her girls tits?"
2583	2585	"Tips." It's "tips."
2586	2587	Tips.
2587	2590	You'll find you picked the wrong man to challenge.
2590	2593	It was you who pro... Look at me when I talk to you.
2594	2595	I don't trust a man who won't meet my eye.
2595	2598	I don't trust it in a bank teller or a salesman.
2598	2602	And I certainly don't trust it in a chief surgeon.
2602	2604	You provoked this confrontation.
2604	2606	You're an incredibly insensitive woman.
2607	2610	Stop thinking of me as a woman and start thinking of me as a person.
2610	2613	That's what Southwest General is made of, people.
2615	2617	And have Nurse Charles see me immediately.
2619	2621	- Push in for a close-up. - Not too close!
2621	2623	Okay, hold it there.
2624	2626	- And cut it! - Stop tape.
2627	2630	Dorothy, it was wonderful the way you held my face.
2631	2632	You controlled me completely.
2633	2635	Thank you, but you had some great moments.
2635	2637	Hold it. Good news, children.
2637	2640	Our brilliant engineers have again erased a reel of the show.
2641	2644	So we have to retape 14, 15 and 16.
2646	2648	It's either that or do it live, tomorrow.
2648	2650	I think we should tape it.
2650	2654	That's a wrap. See you bright and early, 6:30 tomorrow.
2668	2670	- Good night, Dorothy. - Good night, Ben.
2674	2676	That's some day, huh?
2676	2679	What? Oh, you mean about doing it over again.
2680	2682	Tell me, does that happen often?
2682	2685	Every once in a while. We actually had to do it live once.
2685	2686	Live!
2686	2690	You should have seen Van Horn's face. He was so panicked...
2690	2692	...we had to shoot him from the back.
2694	2696	- Want some wine? - No, thanks. I better go home.
2696	2700	I have to wash my hair. Thanks anyway.
2700	2701	- Dorothy? - Yes?
2702	2705	Listen, I know this is exactly what you want to hear now...
2705	2708	...but we've got 26 pages, and I was wondering...
2708	2712	...if you could come over and run some lines with me tonight.
2713	2715	I could make you something to eat.
2715	2716	Night, Fay.
2717	2718	I'm a born defroster.
2718	2720	You don't have a thing to wear?
2720	2723	- She's seen me in all these. - Not in the white thing.
2723	2727	What, this? You cannot wear white to a casual dinner. It's too dressy.
2728	2731	- You couldn't wear pants? - No. Pants? I can't.
2732	2734	- What about this? - No shoes for it.
2734	2736	The lines make me look hippy...
2736	2738	...and it cuts me across the bust.
2739	2741	We're getting into a weird area.
2742	2743	This is smart. What about this?
2743	2745	Looks like you should ring a school bell.
2746	2749	This may seem silly to you, but this is our first date.
2749	2751	I want to look pretty for her.
2753	2755	Hi. What a pretty outfit.
2755	2757	- Glad you like it. - Come on in.
2757	2759	- Brought you something. - You didn't have to.
2760	2761	It wasn't nothing.
2762	2764	Come in. I'll put them in water.
2764	2766	What a big apartment.
2766	2769	- What a lovely, lovely room. - Is it?
2769	2772	- Yes, it's yummy. - I had a decorator do it.
2773	2775	Before, no money. Now, no time.
2775	2778	- Amy is asleep. Finally. - Scared the daylights out of me.
2779	2783	Miss Nichols, that child is never going to learn anything if you keep...
2784	2785	Thank you, Mrs. Crawley.
2786	2788	- Dorothy, Mrs. Crawley. - I'm sorry, I didn't know.
2789	2790	Nice meeting you.
2790	2793	- Scares the shit out of me. - Scared me to death.
2793	2794	Drop your coat here.
2796	2798	- Who is it? - Amy's nanny.
2798	2799	And she hates me.
2799	2800	Who's Amy?
2801	2802	My daughter.
2803	2805	She was 14 months old last week.
2805	2806	I didn't know you had a baby.
2807	2810	You got any kids, Dorothy?
2811	2813	- Were you ever married? - I haven't been that fortunate.
2814	2818	I was engaged once, though, to a brilliant young actor...
2818	2821	...whose career was cut short by the theatrical establishment.
2822	2824	- They killed him? - So to speak.
2824	2827	Sutton gave up acting, and me as well.
2828	2832	He's working now as a waiter in a disreputable restaurant.
2832	2834	I don't want to talk about it.
2834	2835	Maybe you'd like some wine?
2836	2839	No, I think I'd better keep sharp when we work, you know?
2840	2842	You mind if I ask you a question?
2842	2846	Do you worry about using so much heavy makeup on your skin?
2846	2847	I don't worry.
2848	2849	I have a little...
2850	2852	...moustache problem I'm sensitive to.
2852	2855	Probably just too many male hormones or something.
2858	2859	Some men find that attractive.
2860	2863	I know, I know. I just don't like the men that find it attractive.
2867	2869	So you're divorced?
2870	2871	I've never been married.
2873	2875	Perhaps I'll have one little drink.
2883	2885	Tell me about Ron.
2886	2888	- How much time have you got? - Go on.
2888	2890	Well, Ron...
2891	2894	Ron is, hands down, the best director of daytime drama.
2894	2896	Did they tell you not to call it a soap yet?
2897	2900	If anybody calls it a soap opera, Rita fines them a quarter.
2901	2902	It's how she got her car.
2902	2904	You're not telling me about you and Ron.
2905	2909	That's nighttime drama. He's interesting there too.
2909	2911	Oh, you mean he's...
2912	2915	You mean you have a good relationship.
2915	2919	What's a good relationship, Dotty? Can I call you Dotty?
2919	2923	- Oh, please do. - Ron's smart and he's funny.
2923	2925	We got things in common.
2925	2928	You know a guy who wants a woman who eats at four...
2928	2930	...is unconscious by nine and works at dawn?
2931	2933	But how does he treat you?
2933	2935	Oh, that!
2936	2939	- You think I do this without a plan? - What do you mean?
2939	2943	There are a lot of men out there. I'm selective. I look around carefully.
2944	2946	When I find the one who can give me the worst time...
2947	2948	...that's when I make my move.
2958	2960	My lines sound like subtitles for a Czech movie.
2960	2963	Try answering as if the question took you by surprise.
2964	2965	What do you mean?
2965	2967	I'll ask a question. You just answer it.
2968	2969	Why do you drink so much?
2970	2975	When you grow up as I did, an orphan raised by a sister 16 years older...
2976	2977	...you have few illusions.
2977	2979	- There you go. - It made a difference?
2979	2980	You got it.
2980	2982	Thanks, Dorothy.
2984	2986	Why do you drink so much?
2987	2988	Because it's not fattening...
2989	2992	...and it's not good for me. How many things can you say that about?
2993	2995	You telling me to mind my own business.
2995	2997	I just don't think you should worry about it.
2999	3002	- It's nice of you, but... - But I should mind my own business.
3005	3007	It's all so complicated, isn't it?
3008	3010	- What? - All of it.
3010	3013	Don't you find being a woman in the '80s complicated?
3014	3015	Extremely.
3015	3018	- You know what I wish, just once? - What?
3019	3023	That a guy could be honest enough to walk up to me and say...
3023	3025	..."Hey, I'm confused about this too.
3025	3028	I could lay a big line on you, we could do lots of role-playing...
3029	3032	...but the simple truth is, I find you very interesting...
3033	3036	...and I'd really like to make love with you." Simple as that.
3037	3039	- Wouldn't that be a relief? - Heaven.
3040	3041	Sheer heaven.
3042	3046	Ron was supposed to come over last night. I had dinner all ready.
3046	3048	He never showed up.
3048	3049	Oh, my Lord! What time is it?
3050	3051	It's 10:30.
3052	3052	I gotta go.
3053	3057	Listen, forgive me for rushing off. It was a wonderful dinner.
3074	3074	The dinner is burned.
3075	3077	I'm sorry I'm late. But I was taking a shower...
3078	3079	...and the water turned off...
3080	3082	...and I got soap in my eyes.
3082	3086	I had to go to five stores to get chocolate-chocolate chip.
3086	3087	Michael, I saw her.
3088	3089	What? You saw who?
3090	3092	When you were late, I went by your place.
3092	3096	I waited outside and I saw that fat woman go into your apartment.
3096	3098	Fat woman?
3098	3100	The one in the raincoat.
3101	3104	Oh, that woman! That's a friend of Jeff's.
3104	3107	She came over to help him with the play.
3108	3110	They've known each other for years.
3111	3112	You think she's fat?
3112	3115	Well, it was dark but, yes, I thought she was fat.
3115	3118	When did Jeff start collaborating on his play?
3118	3120	She's an excellent typist.
3121	3123	Look, I'm not having an affair with that woman.
3123	3125	It's impossible.
3127	3129	I don't want to make trouble.
3129	3131	I shouldn't have people over. They never show up.
3132	3134	I'm sorry. I feel guilty. You feel guilty. I'm sorry.
3135	3139	Don't do that. Don't apologize because I'm three hours late.
3139	3141	You should be furious.
3141	3143	You've been great to me.
3143	3147	You helped me with the audition for that soap. It's that soap!
3148	3150	That soap!
3151	3153	Did you see that cow they hired?
3154	3155	Cow?
3155	3157	They must've gone a different way.
3158	3159	She is awful.
3162	3164	Well, I heard she was pretty good.
3164	3165	Baloney!
3166	3168	She's supposed to be tough, right?
3168	3170	She's not tough. She's a wimp!
3171	3173	Maybe it's the lines. She doesn't make them up.
3174	3176	Well, I think she should.
3176	3177	They couldn't be any worse.
3177	3179	I can't move out, Miss Kimberly.
3180	3181	I have no place to go.
3182	3184	I don't know what to do.
3187	3191	Don't tell me your husband beats you, but you can't move out.
3191	3194	- Why should you move? - What is she saying?
3194	3195	Three's up. Ready one.
3195	3197	You know what I'd do if somebody did this to me?
3198	3202	I'd pick up the biggest thing around and I'd just...
3203	3204	...bash their brains right through...
3205	3208	...the top of their skull before I'd let them beat me up again.
3210	3212	Well, I can't afford therapy, Miss Kimberly.
3213	3215	Who said anything about therapy?
3215	3216	- Cut it, Ron. - Cut it!
3217	3220	Wait a minute. Her line is "Your husband..."
3220	3221	Wait a second.
3221	3223	May I say in my own defense...
3223	3226	...to tell a woman with two children, no money...
3226	3229	...and a husband who beats her up like this...
3229	3232	...to move into a welfare center to get therapy is a lot of...
3233	3235	...horseshit! I wouldn't do it, would you?
3236	3238	- I can't act with this. - Oh, shut up.
3238	3239	Ron?
3256	3258	I'm partially to blame, Miss Kimberly.
3259	3261	I know I'm pretty, and I use it.
3262	3265	I guess I shouldn't have gone to Dr. Brewster's office so late.
3266	3267	No, that's not true.
3267	3271	Dr. Brewster has tried to seduce several nurses on this ward...
3271	3275	...claiming to be in the throes of an uncontrollable impulse.
3275	3276	Do you know what?
3277	3282	I'm going to give every nurse on this floor an electric cattle prod...
3282	3285	...and instruct them to just zap him in his "badubies."
3286	3287	Cattle prod?
3287	3290	Ruby. Hi, do you want to open up the yellow pages...
3290	3293	...under the section of Farm Equipment...
3361	3364	I am Dorothy. Nobody's writing her. It's coming out of me.
3364	3365	You're Michael acting Dorothy.
3366	3369	It's the same thing. I'm experiencing these feelings.
3369	3374	Why can't you get me a special? I feel I have something to say to women.
3374	3378	- You have nothing to say to women. - I have plenty to say to women.
3379	3381	I've been an unemployed actor for 20 years!
3381	3384	I know what it's like to wait for the phone to ring!
3385	3388	Then when I finally get a job, I have no control! I got zip!
3389	3391	If I could impart that experience to other women...
3391	3394	There are no other women like you. You're a man!
3394	3397	Yes, I realize that, of course. But I'm also an actress.
3398	3401	- We shouldn't argue about this. - I'm a potentially great actress.
3402	3406	I could do Medea, Ophelia, Lady Macbeth. Just like in Shakespeare's day.
3406	3408	Get the writers at the agency...
3408	3410	I could do a great Eleanor Roosevelt.
3410	3412	We can do the Eleanor Roosevelt story!
3412	3414	The Eleanor Roosevelt story?
3414	3416	What's the matter with that?
3416	3419	Phil Weintraub's party is Saturday. Let's just go.
3419	3422	Have a good time. Don't take yourself so seriously.
3422	3425	- He never invited me to a party. - I'm inviting you.
3426	3428	He did a fabulous job on your eyes.
3428	3430	I can't blink for a week. Really.
3431	3433	- I don't like it here. - Stand up straight.
3441	3443	- What do you want? - A double champagne.
3445	3448	What is this? Just serve yourself?
3449	3450	Hi. What would you like?
3451	3452	Give me two...
3454	3456	- Two what? - Of anything.
3461	3463	- I'm sorry... - A couple of champagnes.
3468	3472	- Can I get you something? - Vodka on the rocks with a twist.
3473	3474	You don't remember me?
3474	3477	When I came in, I thought you looked familiar.
3477	3480	- What's your name again? - Suzanne.
3480	3482	Call Pamela Green, my agent.
3482	3484	Paramount's interested. I'll know after the first.
3485	3486	I'll read it after the first.
3486	3489	Actually, I'm not that crazy about the script.
3489	3493	I'm having a rewrite done. Maybe we could have dinner.
3494	3496	Call Pamela. She handles me for dinner.
3496	3497	Do you have a light?
3498	3499	- How've you been? - Great.
3499	3501	- Good. - You look wonderful.
3503	3505	Silly me, I already had dinner.
3506	3508	I didn't know there'd be so much food.
3508	3509	It's for my dog.
3510	3510	He likes fruit.
3512	3514	Mike Dorsey.
3515	3516	Great view, huh?
3517	3520	Only Phil could afford all those lights.
3521	3522	You know...
3523	3526	...I could lay a big line on you...
3526	3529	...and we could do a lot of role-playing, but the simple truth...
3530	3532	...is that I find you very interesting.
3533	3534	And I'd like to make love to you.
3535	3537	You know? It's as sim...
3540	3541	As simple as that.
3552	3554	I understand who you really are.
3555	3558	And I'll no longer submit to your petty insults and humiliations.
3558	3561	It's not necessary now that Emily Kimberly's here.
3561	3564	Now that someone who sees the truth is your equal.
3564	3567	Listen, doctor, I've filed charges against you with the AMA.
3568	3569	You'll be notified tomorrow.
3570	3572	- And cut it. - Cut.
3572	3573	It's a good one.
3575	3576	Perfect.
3576	3578	- That was great. - Thanks, John.
3579	3581	- Lovely job. First-rate. - You were wonderful.
3581	3582	Thanks to my coach.
3583	3584	No, you did it yourself.
3584	3586	- Was it okay? - I loved the middle...
3586	3588	So much for the mutual-admiration society.
3589	3592	Let's move on to item 17. Jo, clear this set.
3592	3595	I'll need Alan, Tom and John.
3595	3597	Tootsie, take 10.
3597	3598	Ron?
3598	3599	My name is Dorothy.
3600	3602	It's not Tootsie or Toots or Sweetie or Honey or Doll.
3603	3605	- Oh, Christ. - No, just Dorothy.
3606	3608	Alan's always Alan, Tom's always Tom and John's always John.
3609	3613	I have a name too. It's Dorothy, capital D-O-R-O-T-H-Y.
3613	3614	Dorothy.
3616	3617	Excuse me, doctor.
3631	3632	Did somebody die?
3633	3635	- Violinist. - I didn't know he was that sick.
3636	3638	He wasn't. He asked for a raise.
3641	3643	I'm sorry about what happened out there.
3645	3647	- I was upset. - What're you doing for the holidays?
3648	3649	Why?
3650	3654	Well, the baby and I are gonna go up to my dad's farm upstate.
3654	3658	It's not exactly the fast lane, but it's kind of fun.
3658	3660	Maybe you'd like to come along?
3662	3666	You know, since my dad met you, he's your biggest fan.
3667	3668	Is Ron coming too?
3670	3672	Would that make a difference?
3673	3674	Actually...
3674	3677	...I think he has to stay in town and work.
3680	3681	If it matters...
3681	3685	...I've always hated women who treat other women as stand-ins for men.
3686	3688	It's not that, really.
3689	3690	I'd just like you to come.
3691	3695	I just don't want to get up too soon or I'll have another relapse.
3695	3699	Isn't there some way we could rehearse in the same room together?
3699	3702	We will. Right after the weekend. I'll call you Monday.
3702	3704	Thanks. Bye-bye.
3704	3707	You know where my pink nightgown is? With the flow...
3707	3708	- Listen to me. - What?
3709	3710	Stop packing.
3710	3711	Don't do this.
3711	3713	- Why? - You should not do this.
3713	3717	In two weeks, if I ever see Julie again, it'll be as Michael...
3717	3719	...and she'll probably throw a drink in my face.
3720	3723	- How can you keep lying to Sandy? - It's for her own good.
3723	3727	I never told Sandy I wouldn't see other women. Come on.
3727	3730	If I told her, it would hurt her and I don't want to do that.
3730	3733	Especially since Julie and I are just girlfriends.
3733	3735	I'm just afraid you'll burn in hell for this.
3736	3739	I don't believe in hell. I believe in unemployment.
3769	3772	- Wait! Let me get those. - Oh, well, thank you.
3773	3775	- Strong little thing, aren't you? - Well, no.
3778	3780	Come on, Dorothy. I'll show you the house.
3781	3784	- Careful coming up here. - It really is old, isn't it?
3786	3787	Here we are.
3790	3792	I'll set up the crib in a second.
3792	3793	Unpack your bags and we'll...
3794	3795	Wait. Are we sharing?
3795	3798	The upstairs is shut off. And I know you girls.
3798	3802	No matter what, you'll sneak back together and spend the night giggling.
3803	3805	He still thinks I'm 12.
3806	3807	Which side do you want?
3808	3810	I think the one closest to the bathroom.
3811	3812	I won't take up much room.
3822	3825	Take it between your thumb and forefinger.
3825	3828	Let every finger roll down individually. That's it, yes.
3829	3830	My goodness.
3831	3832	You'll be all right.
3934	3937	Special up here, isn't it?
3937	3939	I'm glad you came.
3942	3943	Can I tell you something?
3943	3944	Sweetheart?
3945	3947	Ron is on the phone.
3947	3949	Hi. I'm sorry.
3949	3951	- What, Dorothy? - Nothing.
3952	3954	- I think I'll put her down. - Good.
3955	3957	Gets a little chilly out here.
3958	3961	- No, I was just... - I brought this sweater for you.
3961	3963	Thank you. Very nice of you, Les.
3963	3964	Thank you.
3972	3975	I wonder if we're going to get any stars out of the sky tonight?
3976	3977	I've got my stars.
3978	3979	You and Julie.
4008	4010	- It's beautiful. - I should've transposed it.
4011	4012	It's wonderful for a lady to play piano.
4013	4014	Quit. Mama insisted.
4014	4017	- Who wants another drink? - You better take it easy.
4017	4019	- Remember Injun Joe. - What's that?
4019	4020	Don't you tell that story.
4021	4023	- This bar Daddy hangs out in... - I don't.
4024	4026	He and Injun Joe threw back a few too many.
4026	4027	Hard liquor.
4027	4028	They thought they saw this elk.
4029	4030	They stalked it for a couple hours.
4031	4033	They cornered it up against Charlie's barn.
4033	4036	About the time they were ready to blast it, it mooed.
4037	4038	It was a cow?
4039	4041	Enough laughing at your old man.
4041	4042	You know this one?
4046	4046	Wait a minute.
4074	4076	- Bravo! - That was Julie's mother's name.
4077	4079	Mary Juliet Cooper.
4081	4082	Well, I'm going to bed.
4083	4085	Do you wanna hit the hay, as they say on the farm?
4086	4090	I think I'll... You and... Both of you go to bed.
4090	4091	- I'll stay up. - I'll stay with you.
4093	4094	Well, I'm going.
4095	4096	- Good night. - Good night, dear.
4097	4098	Good night, Dad.
4098	4099	Sleep well.
4100	4102	Be good.
4105	4107	- Nice girl, isn't she? - Very sweet.
4107	4108	I'm kind of glad Ron didn't come up.
4109	4111	You know I am too, actually.
4111	4112	Really?
4113	4116	- I'm sorry. Please, sit down. - Thank you.
4116	4119	I thought you'd be more like one of them "liberators."
4120	4122	You know, I'm not really like the woman on the show.
4123	4125	I mean, it's just a part. I'm not that militant.
4126	4128	Don't get me wrong. I'm all for equality.
4128	4132	Women ought to be entitled to everything and all, et cetera.
4132	4133	Except...
4134	4137	...sometimes I think what they really want is to be men.
4137	4140	Like men are all equal in the first place. We're not.
4141	4142	Can I get you another drink?
4143	4144	I must keep my wits tonight.
4144	4145	Tonight?
4146	4147	Well, always.
4147	4148	I remember years ago...
4148	4151	...there wasn't talk about what a woman was, what a man was.
4152	4153	You just were what you were.
4154	4157	Now they have all this stuff about being like the other sex...
4158	4162	...so you can all be the same. Well, I'm sorry, but we're just not.
4162	4164	Not on a farm, anyway.
4164	4167	Bulls are bulls, and roosters don't try to lay eggs.
4168	4169	Never.
4172	4175	My wife and I, we were married a lot of years.
4175	4176	People got it all wrong.
4177	4179	They say your health is the most important thing.
4179	4182	But I can lift this house off the ground. What good is it?
4182	4184	Being with someone.
4184	4185	Sharing.
4186	4188	That's what it's all about.
4190	4192	- Julie says you're not married. - No.
4193	4194	Like another drink?
4194	4195	- No. - You sure?
4195	4199	Yes. Well, you know what? I think it is about that time.
4200	4204	- Thanks for staying up and talking. - Don't you mention it.
4207	4209	You have beautiful eyes.
4209	4210	Oh, well, thank you.
4212	4213	Good night, Les.
4259	4261	Daddy's a little out of touch, isn't he?
4261	4263	No. Very sweet, very sweet.
4264	4267	He sees things pretty simply.
4268	4270	You're either happy or unhappy.
4270	4272	Married or not married.
4273	4275	There's nothing in between.
4283	4288	I tried to get him to take out other women after Mama died but...
4288	4292	You know, she must have been a very special person.
4293	4297	I guess so. I don't remember her very well.
4297	4301	I remember her helping me pick out this wallpaper.
4304	4307	I'd chosen one with great big, purple flowers on it.
4308	4309	And she said to me...
4309	4312	..."Just remember that once you choose it...
4313	4317	...it's gonna cover the walls of your room for a long, long time."
4318	4323	So I tried to imagine what those big, purple flowers would look like...
4323	4325	...on all the walls of my room...
4326	4328	...every night when I was falling asleep...
4329	4331	...and every morning when I was getting dressed.
4332	4337	So I said to her, "Which one would you choose, Mom?"
4339	4343	And she said, "The one with the daisies and the little rosebuds...
4343	4348	...because daisies are such homey flowers...
4350	4354	...and rosebuds are so cheerful and always waiting to bloom."
4355	4357	That's lovely.
4358	4362	I made a million plans looking at this wallpaper.
4367	4370	I was always waiting for these rosebuds to open.
4389	4391	That's nice.
4393	4396	My mother used to do that too, sometimes.
4402	4405	- Good night, Julie. - Good night, Dottie.
4420	4422	Cathy Campbell, please call your office.
4422	4424	It says "cool."
4425	4428	Don't you think I should be angry? Doesn't it play better?
4428	4430	Yes. Why don't you try that?
4431	4434	This just came to our dressing room for you.
4434	4437	- I think it's from Julie's father. - Oh, my!
4437	4441	Now don't you dare eat any. You don't want to ruin your cute figure.
4441	4444	What a thoughtless present to give a woman.
4444	4445	Chocolates!
4445	4448	Dorothy Michaels, Rita Marshall's office.
4449	4450	You're a complicated lady.
4451	4454	On the one hand, you're a real pain in the ass.
4454	4457	I've got one of the most expensive directors in soaps...
4458	4459	I owe myself a quarter.
4460	4462	And you've got him defensive and hostile.
4463	4464	I don't mean to.
4464	4467	However, we're getting 2000 letters a week...
4467	4470	...and we've picked up three share points.
4470	4472	And it's largely due to you.
4473	4476	You are the first woman character who is her own person.
4476	4479	Who asserts her own personality without robbing someone of theirs.
4479	4481	You're a breakthrough lady for us.
4482	4485	We're picking up your option for another year. Congratulations.
4487	4490	Come on, Mike. What do you mean, get you out of it?
4490	4493	There's no way out. It's their option.
4493	4494	What? Who gave them that?
4495	4497	You signed the standard contract.
4497	4501	But I didn't know I'd be working for the rest of my life as a woman!
4501	4502	You gotta make it work.
4503	4506	They'll pay. They'll go from 650 to 850 an episode.
4506	4509	You get me out of this, or I'll go in and tell them.
4509	4510	Tell them what?
4510	4512	That you put a network on the spot?
4512	4515	You're making a fool out of women? They'll kill you!
4515	4519	My secretary wants to be like Dorothy Michaels. I want to fire her.
4520	4524	We're talking major fraud here. Major fraud! You can't tell them.
4524	4528	What about me? You think anybody will believe I wasn't in on this?
4528	4532	It's not just ruining yourself. This is ruining me too.
4532	4535	You can't do it. You gotta make it work.
4535	4538	- Can you take that many Valium? - We'll see.
4538	4541	Maybe your contract has a morals clause.
4541	4545	If Dorothy did something filthy or disgusting, they'd let you go.
4546	4551	But you've already done everything filthy and disgusting on your show.
4557	4560	Dorothy, it's Julie.
4560	4564	There's sort of an emergency. Well, it's not really an emergency...
4565	4567	...but if you get a chance, would you call me?
4567	4571	- Are you sure you wanna do this? - No, but I'm going to.
4571	4574	I've been fooling myself about Ron for too long now.
4575	4579	I guess I really wanted you here for moral support.
4579	4582	Although I did fire Mrs. Crawley today. I really did.
4582	4585	- Want a drink? - I'm not the one breaking up with Ron.
4585	4587	I'd buy a ticket to that.
4587	4591	You have influenced me though. I've seen Ron through your eyes.
4591	4593	Julie, I don't want that responsibility.
4594	4595	Why shouldn't you influence me?
4595	4598	You wouldn't compromise your feelings like I have...
4598	4600	...or live this kind of lie.
4600	4602	Well, no, I wouldn't. But...
4602	4604	Of course not. And you're right. It's just...
4605	4608	I deserve something better. I don't have to settle for this.
4608	4612	But I've always been too lazy or too scared or too something.
4613	4615	Don't be so hard on yourself.
4615	4617	What the hell? I'll live, won't I?
4617	4620	Maybe not happily, but honestly.
4620	4622	Sounds like something you'd say.
4622	4627	You mustn't idealize me. Honesty, in many ways, is a relative term.
4627	4629	My father's coming.
4629	4631	If he calls, don't say anything about this.
4631	4634	He's coming tonight. He'll want to see you.
4634	4635	Me?
4636	4637	Oh, God!
4637	4638	It's Ron.
4639	4641	Oh, Dorothy, God bless you.
4642	4643	Wish me luck now.
4643	4644	Always.
4644	4648	I feel that little moustache. You should put some makeup on it.
4654	4655	How're you doing?
4657	4658	What's going on?
4658	4660	Dorothy's gonna sit with Amy.
4660	4662	- I'll be right back. - Okay.
4664	4666	Hi, honey.
4667	4670	You don't mind if I call you honey when we're not working?
4677	4678	Nice dress.
4678	4680	Thank you.
4681	4683	You don't like me, do you?
4683	4685	I can respect that...
4685	4689	...but there's not many women I can't make like me.
4689	4691	Why don't you like me?
4691	4693	I don't like the way you treat Julie.
4694	4695	Oh?
4695	4699	I don't like the way you patronize her, deceive her and lie to her.
4700	4700	What do you mean?
4701	4702	You want me to go on?
4702	4704	No, I know what you mean.
4706	4711	Look, I never promised Julie I'd be exclusive and not see other women.
4711	4714	But I know she doesn't want me to see them...
4714	4716	...so I lie to her to keep from hurting her.
4717	4719	That's very convenient.
4719	4722	No, wait a minute. Look at it from my side.
4723	4726	See, if a woman wants me to seduce her...
4726	4727	...I usually do.
4728	4733	But then she pretends I promised her something. Then I pretend I did.
4733	4735	In the end, I'm the one that's exploited.
4735	4737	Bullshit, Ron!
4737	4739	You know what?
4739	4742	I understand you a lot better than you think I do.
4742	4743	Really?
4744	4745	I'm ready.
4748	4751	- Julie's ready. - She sure is.
4751	4753	Dorothy, she never wakes up.
4754	4757	But if she does, there's applesauce in the fridge.
4757	4759	Give her a couple spoonfuls.
4759	4762	I'm sure she... Are you sure you'll be okay?
4762	4765	Don't be silly. How much trouble can a baby be? Go on.
4766	4769	It's okay. Oh, it's okay.
4770	4773	Oh, please don't cry. Please don't cry.
4774	4776	Oh, I love you.
4776	4778	Look how much fun we're having.
4781	4783	It's all right. It's all right.
4783	4785	It's okay. It's Uncle Dorothy.
4785	4788	Please don't cry. Please don't cry. Please.
4788	4792	Oh, come on. Oh, here's funny clown.
4792	4794	Funny clown's talking to... Look.
4794	4796	Come on, Amy. Hello, Amy.
4797	4799	Amy... Give me a break, will you?
4799	4803	Here, come on. Will you eat some more now?
4803	4806	You told me to open up this one. Now this is apri...
4811	4812	Gotcha! Gotcha!
4813	4814	You want a little more apricot?
4815	4818	Don't do that anymore. Don't do that to Aunt Dorothy.
4818	4819	You'll go to sleep after this.
4820	4822	Just try this one, and then I'll put you...
4824	4827	I don't like you. It's not funny.
4828	4830	Amy, look at this.
4831	4832	She'll have to paint the kitchen.
4832	4835	Here, look at yourself. You see what a bad girl looks like?
4859	4860	Dorothy?
4862	4864	I'll be right there.
4868	4869	How's Amy? Any trouble?
4870	4872	Oh, not at all. She was an angel.
4872	4874	Are you all right?
4874	4875	Fine.
4887	4888	What's the matter?
4902	4905	Tell the truth now. Are you sure you're all right?
4906	4907	No.
4907	4908	Why?
4909	4911	Who am I going to have dinner with?
4912	4916	Oh, God! I hate myself for being like this.
4920	4922	- You know something funny? - What?
4922	4925	And I don't want you to take this the wrong way.
4926	4930	But since I met you, I'm so grateful to have you as a friend.
4930	4932	And yet, at the same time...
4932	4935	...I've never felt lonelier in my whole life.
4938	4942	It's as though I want something that I just can't have.
4942	4943	You know what I mean?
4951	4952	Do you?
4959	4960	- Dorothy? - Julie!
4961	4962	- My God! - Let me explain.
4963	4964	Don't say anything.
4964	4966	- There's a reason. - I understand.
4966	4969	That's not the reason. I'm not who you think I am.
4969	4971	- Just wait a minute. - Nobody is.
4972	4973	- It's me. - No, it's me.
4973	4974	- No, it's me. - No, it's me.
4975	4976	I'm not well-adjusted enough.
4977	4980	I'm sure I've got the same impulses. Obviously, I did.
4980	4983	Don't jump to conclusions about that impulse.
4983	4986	If you could just see me out of these clothes...
4986	4987	What? What?
4988	4990	That's my father! You've got to tell him.
4990	4992	- Tell him. - Tell him what?
4992	4993	That I... That's a corncob.
4996	4997	Hi, Dad.
4997	4998	Fine.
4998	5000	I'm here with Dorothy.
5002	5004	I can't tonight, Daddy. But wait.
5005	5008	You've got to see him. Just don't lead him on.
5008	5011	- Please don't make me do this. - You gotta let him down gently.
5012	5014	- I can't. - You owe me that.
5022	5025	Hi, Les. I'm fine. How are you?
5026	5028	Tonight, sure. Tonight?
5031	5033	- What'll you have? - Just water.
5033	5036	- Water and bourbon. - Make that a straight scotch.
5036	5038	Scotch and bourbon.
5039	5040	I'd like to...
5040	5042	- Let's dance. - What?
5042	5045	- It's my favorite dance. - Oh, really, I don't dance.
5045	5046	- You'll love it. - What?
5047	5050	- Follow me. Follow me. - Please, I don't...
5052	5055	You know what? I'd... Really, I'd rather not.
5058	5059	- Just relax. - You're very good.
5060	5063	- My wife and I took a course. - I could tell at once.
5064	5066	- Emily, we love you. - You're fabulous!
5067	5068	- Just wonderful. - Wonderful.
5068	5071	- You're even prettier in person. - Thank you.
5074	5077	I'm sorry. I forgot that you're on your feet all day.
5077	5080	- Come on, sit down. - Yes, I think we should stop.
5082	5083	- Thank you. - Thank you.
5084	5086	I was happy you could come out tonight.
5086	5088	I know you usually got a lot of lines to learn.
5089	5092	- There's something I'd better say. - I want to say something too.
5093	5095	Wouldn't it be funny if we both said the same thing?
5096	5097	It'd be hilarious. But I doubt it.
5098	5102	Well, mine's pretty simple. I'm not too good with words anyway.
5103	5105	I only took two pictures in my life...
5106	5108	...my high-school graduation and my wedding.
5109	5111	My wife stood next to me in both.
5111	5114	I never thought I'd want anybody to fill her place.
5115	5116	That changed last weekend.
5116	5117	- Lester. - Lesley.
5117	5119	- Lesley... - Don't interrupt me.
5119	5121	I gotta do this in one go or I won't do it.
5122	5124	I know this is kind of quick, but that's how I am.
5125	5128	Never did believe in not getting down to it.
5128	5130	Don't say anything now...
5130	5133	I know it's fast. But take time to think about it.
5133	5136	If you say no, at least I'll feel you took me seriously.
5136	5138	Would you mind? I just need to be alone.
5139	5142	I'd like to start thinking it over as soon as possible.
5147	5148	Dorothy?
5150	5152	This is a nightmare.
5152	5154	Don't be angry. I had to talk to you.
5155	5157	- How'd you know where I live? - I followed you.
5157	5161	- What? Followed me home? - I didn't have the courage to phone you.
5161	5165	- Could I come up for a drink? - No, you can't! I have a headache.
5165	5169	Please! I'll only take a tiny moment of your time.
5170	5173	I'll see you on the set tomorrow and we'll talk about it.
5175	5177	Go home. Have you been drinking?
5205	5208	Shh! Are you out of your cotton-picking mind?
5208	5210	Come on up! I'm on the third floor!
5211	5213	Hurry before someone calls the cops!
5214	5215	Jesus!
5218	5220	Come in, but you can just stay a minute.
5221	5224	Can I have a drink? Anything alcoholic will do.
5225	5229	- Just one drink and I'll go. - Oh, all right, but I...
5230	5231	Nice mirror.
5239	5240	Here.
5241	5243	What is it that couldn't wait?
5244	5248	I'm just an untalented old has-been.
5248	5250	Were you ever famous?
5250	5253	- No. - Then how can you be a has-been?
5253	5256	I love the way you never let me get away with anything.
5260	5261	- Dorothy... - Yes?
5262	5263	- I want you. - Pardon?
5264	5268	- I've never wanted a woman this much! - Please! Perhaps another time.
5268	5269	Turn me away, it'll kill me!
5270	5273	- I don't want emotional involvement. - I'll take sex.
5273	5275	- I don't want to hurt you. - I don't mind.
5275	5276	Oh, shit!
5283	5286	John Van Horn, Jeff Slater.
5287	5289	Jeff Slater, John Van Horn.
5290	5291	How do you do?
5291	5292	How do you do?
5293	5296	- I'll be going. - I think it's best.
5301	5304	- Gee, I hope I haven't... - No, I hope I haven't...
5305	5308	I want you to know, for the record...
5308	5311	...that nothing happened here tonight.
5314	5316	Thank you, John.
5319	5321	I'm sorry, Dorothy.
5322	5325	I didn't understand. I'm really sorry.
5326	5327	Please don't talk about this.
5328	5329	My lips are sealed.
5337	5338	You slut!
5339	5341	Look, don't start in with me. Don't do that.
5342	5344	Rape is not a laughing matter.
5345	5346	That guy wanted me.
5347	5350	You cannot believe the night I have had tonight!
5350	5352	- I think I can imagine. - No, you can't.
5352	5354	I saw his eyes. I was in trouble.
5354	5357	If you don't come in, I'm in the Daily News the next day.
5358	5359	How did you ever let him in?
5359	5362	What do you mean? He was singing.
5362	5365	- Is he that good a singer? - What do you..?
5365	5366	That's him!
5366	5368	Say I'm in the bedroom crying. Don't let him in!
5369	5370	Michael.
5370	5371	It's Sandy.
5371	5373	Sandy? It's Sandy?
5373	5375	I can't let her see me like this.
5375	5377	I hear you in there.
5378	5381	Open the door. It's me, Sandy. Open the door!
5381	5383	- Sandy, is that you? - Yes!
5383	5386	What time is it? I fell asleep, I guess.
5386	5388	I was having a nightmare and you were in it.
5389	5390	Mike's in the shower.
5390	5393	I'm in the shower! I got soap in my eyes!
5393	5396	I'm not dressed. I was asleep. I was dreaming.
5397	5399	You were in my dream. You had big teeth.
5399	5400	I had big what?
5400	5403	- I gotta get something on. - Are you having a party?
5404	5406	I'm in the shower! Turn on the water!
5406	5411	It's stuck! I got soap in my eyes and there's no water coming out!
5411	5413	I can't come out with soap in my eyes!
5413	5414	Open the door!
5416	5419	I can hear you in there, you guys. Open the door!
5421	5424	- Open this door. - The door was open.
5424	5426	You must think I'm really stupid.
5426	5428	No one would say it to your face.
5428	5432	I've been out there for 10 minutes. It sounded like a party in here.
5432	5435	Well, Mike was in the shower. You know.
5435	5438	- Hi, I was taking a shower. - He was in the shower.
5438	5439	- Good shower? - Good shower.
5440	5442	Why haven't you returned my phone calls?
5442	5444	I'll go do some writing. Excuse me.
5445	5447	Wait, I'll be back. I got a present for you.
5448	5449	Pigs!
5449	5452	I'm glad you came over. I've been meaning to give this to you.
5453	5456	- I suppose this means nothing's wrong? - Nothing is. Is it?
5457	5459	I've called you all week and you haven't called back.
5459	5461	- You treat me like I'm a jerk. - What?
5462	5464	- I called and you didn't call back! - No, it's...
5465	5468	My new answering machine is no good. I'll answer my own calls.
5469	5473	- I went to six stores for your favorite. - Chocolate-covered cherries?
5473	5475	That's sweet. Oh, and a card.
5476	5478	Oh, yeah. No, no! Don't, don't read it!
5479	5480	I was very angry when I wrote that!
5481	5483	"Thank you for the lovely night in front of the fire.
5483	5485	Missing you, Les."
5488	5490	This isn't for me. It's another girl's candy.
5491	5493	I wouldn't give you another girl's candy.
5493	5495	- Then, whose is it? - Mine.
5496	5498	A guy named Les sends you candy?
5498	5501	Yes. He's a friend of mine. He can't eat candy. He's diabetic.
5502	5505	Why is he thanking you for a lovely night in front of the fire?
5506	5508	My mind's a blank.
5511	5512	Are you gay?
5514	5516	In what sense?
5516	5519	Just be honest with me. For once in your life tell the truth!
5519	5523	Because these stories are very demeaning to me.
5523	5525	No matter how bad the truth is...
5526	5528	...it doesn't tear you apart inside like dishonesty.
5529	5532	At least it leaves you with some self-respect and some dignity.
5533	5534	You're right.
5537	5539	Okay. Okay.
5540	5542	I'm not gonna lie to you anymore.
5544	5546	I'm gonna tell you the truth. Sandy...
5547	5549	I'm in love with another woman.
5551	5552	What are you saying?!
5552	5554	- Sandy, please. Don't... - You liar!
5555	5556	We never said "I love you."
5556	5558	- We went to bed one time. - I don't care.
5559	5562	You're a dear friend. But let's not pretend it was something else!
5563	5564	We're gonna lose everything!
5564	5567	I don't care about "I love you!" I read The Second Sex...
5567	5571	...and The Cinderella Complex! I'm responsible for my own orgasms!
5571	5573	I just don't like to be lied to!
5574	5576	You asked me to be straight with you.
5576	5578	I didn't say how I'd feel about it.
5578	5581	- What can I do? - There's nothing you can do for me.
5581	5583	I just have to feel like this...
5583	5586	...and you have to know you made me feel this way!
5586	5588	- Aren't we still friends? - No!
5588	5591	I don't take this shit from friends, only from lovers.
5591	5594	- Wait, what about the play? - What about it?
5594	5596	I should tell you to shove your play.
5596	5599	But I won't, because I never allow personal despair...
5600	5601	...to ruin my professional commitments.
5602	5604	I am a professional actress!
5605	5609	So, are these real chocolate-covered cherries?
5610	5611	I think so.
5613	5615	- See you at rehearsal. - Oh, Sandy...
5615	5617	Don't call me.
5618	5620	It's 2 a.m. Can't this wait?
5620	5623	I don't care. Get me off this show in 10 days.
5623	5626	- It's impossible. - Then I'm getting a new agent.
5626	5628	You hurt my feelings. What happened?
5628	5631	I told her about Julie. She thinks I'm gay.
5632	5634	- Julie thinks your gay? - No, my friend Sandy.
5635	5636	Well, sleep with her.
5636	5639	- I did and she still thinks I'm gay. - Oh, that's not so good.
5639	5642	I gotta get back to my life. You got lots of lawyers...
5643	5645	...there must be a way to get me out of this show.
5646	5649	- We've been through this. - Why can't Dorothy have an accident?
5649	5652	We can use our imaginations. This isn't too tough.
5652	5655	Kill somebody and bring back the stiff, but she'd better look like you.
5656	5659	- They don't miss a trick. - These are nice, good people.
5660	5663	Since when do you care so much about what other people feel?
5663	5667	You should have seen Julie's face when she thought I was a lesbian.
5668	5669	Lesbian? You just said "gay."
5670	5672	Sandy thinks I'm gay. Julie thinks I'm a lesbian.
5672	5674	- I thought Dorothy was straight. - She is.
5674	5678	Les, the sweetest man in the world, asked me to marry him.
5678	5680	A guy named Les wants to marry you?
5680	5682	Yeah. No, wants to marry Dorothy.
5682	5684	- He knows she's a lesbian? - She's not!
5685	5687	- I know that, but does he? - Know what?
5687	5689	That... Well, I don't know.
5689	5693	You know he gave me a ring? He gave me a diamond ring.
5693	5694	What did you say?
5695	5696	"I got to think it over."
5696	5699	I went in the ladies' room and almost pissed in the sink.
5700	5702	Thirteen's up. Ready 14.
5702	5704	Widen E. Pull three to 130.
5705	5707	- Cut it. - Stop tape.
5708	5710	We're gonna take a short break, people.
5710	5714	Hold it, hold it! Slight change of plans, children.
5714	5717	Our future ex-tape editor spilled a bottle of celery tonic...
5718	5721	...on the second reel of the show airing today.
5721	5723	So we have to redo Emily's party scene, live.
5723	5725	- Live? - Quick, like bunnies.
5725	5727	You have 26 minutes. Get into wardrobe.
5728	5730	- But Rita... - You've only got a few lines.
5730	5733	Well, I don't see why we can't use the tape.
5733	5735	Just because it's a little sticky.
5742	5746	Explain to them that the hours have to be flexible.
5746	5750	No... And I would...
5755	5757	Can I call you back? Thank you.
5762	5765	My God, Dorothy! I just... Really, I can't.
5765	5766	It's for Amy.
5767	5769	Oh, thanks.
5769	5770	That's nice.
5771	5774	- I don't know how to say this... - I wish you wouldn't.
5775	5779	I understand that you weren't able to tell my dad last night.
5779	5784	So it'd be better for all of us if I tried to explain it to him.
5784	5787	Look, I wouldn't be honest if I didn't tell you...
5788	5791	...how much you've meant to me these past couple weeks.
5792	5796	You taught me how to stand up for myself because you always do.
5797	5801	You taught me to stop hiding and just be myself...
5801	5803	...because you're always yourself.
5805	5806	I'm grateful to you.
5808	5809	But...
5811	5813	Well, I just...
5813	5816	I just can't see you anymore, you know?
5819	5824	I just feel it would be leading you on. It wouldn't be fair to you.
5826	5828	I really love you, Dorothy.
5829	5831	But I can't...
5831	5833	I can't love you.
5833	5835	Places, everybody. Immediately!
5836	5839	Fifteen seconds to commercial.
5840	5842	I don't care how you get there.
5842	5845	This is the most important night in Emily's life.
5845	5849	We're all going to be there to honor her, including you.
5855	5857	Stand by. Quiet, please, on the floor.
5858	5858	Stand by.
5859	5861	Twenty-two and 23 come down to 18.
5862	5863	Hold it. That's good.
5863	5866	Five, four, three...
5871	5875	Let's raise our glasses to our guest of honor, Ms. Emily Kimberly.
5878	5882	We're looking forward to having you grace us with your presence...
5882	5885	...for many years to come.
5889	5892	Thank you, Gordon. I can't tell you all how moved I am.
5893	5894	I never in my wildest dreams...
5894	5899	...imagined that I would be the object of so much genuine affection.
5906	5910	It makes it more difficult for me to say what I'm now going to say.
5912	5915	I do feel it's time to set the record straight.
5916	5918	I didn't come here just as an administrator.
5918	5921	I came to this hospital to settle a score.
5921	5922	What score?
5922	5924	My father built this hospital.
5924	5926	But to his family...
5926	5929	...he was an unmerciful tyrant. An absolute dodo bird.
5930	5931	Oh, no! Not live.
5931	5932	Let's see where she goes.
5932	5934	He drove my mother to drink.
5934	5937	In fact, she went riding one time and lost all her teeth.
5937	5938	What? What?
5939	5943	- the oldest daughter, the pretty, charming one, became pregnant...
5943	5945	...at 15 and was driven out of the house.
5946	5950	She was so terrified that her daughter would bear the stigma of illegitimacy...
5951	5955	...she changed her name and contracted a disfiguring disease...
5959	5963	...after moving to Tangiers, where she raised the girl as her sister.
5963	5965	But her one ambition...
5965	5967	Any preference of shots on this one?
5967	5969	- was to become a nurse.
5970	5973	So she returned to the States and joined the staff right here...
5974	5975	...at Southwest General.
5976	5978	She worked here and had to speak out...
5978	5980	...wherever she saw injustice and inhumanity.
5981	5983	Don't you understand that, Dr. Brewster?
5983	5984	I never laid a hand on her.
5985	5987	Yes, you did. She was shunned by all you nurses too.
5988	5990	Give me something, one. Not backs.
5990	5992	Two and three go left and right.
5992	5994	No, two go left! Three go right!
5994	5997	Her outspokenness threatened you doctors.
5997	6001	But she was deeply, deeply, deeply loved...
6001	6003	...by her brother. - Her brother?
6003	6005	This brother, on the day of her death...
6005	6009	...swore to the good Lord above he'd follow in her footsteps.
6009	6011	And, and, and...
6013	6015	...just, just, just...
6017	6018	Don't, don't, don't panic.
6019	6022	...owe it all up to her! But on her terms!
6022	6023	Here come the terms.
6023	6025	As a woman...
6025	6028	...and just as proud to be a woman...
6029	6030	...as she ever was...
6033	6035	...for I am not Emily Kimberly...
6036	6038	...the daughter of Dwayne...
6039	6041	...and Alma Kimberly.
6042	6043	No, I'm not.
6045	6048	I'm Edward Kimberly, Anthea's reckless brother.
6049	6050	Holy Christ!
6052	6055	Edward Kimberly, who's finally vindicated his sister's good name.
6056	6057	I'm Edward Kimberly.
6058	6059	Edward Kimberly.
6059	6062	- I'll be damned. - I'm not mentally ill, but proud...
6062	6066	...and lucky to be the woman that was the best part of my manhood.
6068	6069	The best part of myself.
6070	6073	That is one nutty hospital.
6074	6076	I knew there was a reason she didn't like me!
6076	6077	Cut it!
6078	6079	Cut!
6095	6096	Does Jeff know?
6147	6149	Hey, Robert.
6158	6159	Hi, Les.
6160	6161	Get him!
6163	6164	All right!
6167	6170	Get him! Get him! Get him! Oh, come on.
6210	6213	- I thought you'd want it back. - Outside.
6213	6215	Give it to me outside.
6226	6228	Why'd you do it?
6229	6231	I needed the work.
6233	6237	The only reason you're still living is because I never kissed you.
6239	6241	I hope you enjoyed the chocolates.
6243	6245	I gave them to a girl.
6245	6247	So did I. I thought.
6249	6250	Do you like them?
6250	6252	- Chocolates? - Girls!
6253	6255	I like Julie.
6257	6259	I think I love Julie.
6259	6261	Wearing a dress is a funny way to show it.
6262	6264	I know. I apologize.
6270	6273	The truth is, you were okay company.
6274	6275	So were you.
6275	6277	I could have done without the dancing.
6278	6280	You know, you're very good.
6281	6285	- I'm seeing a real nice woman now. - Oh, really?
6286	6287	You think I didn't check her out?
6290	6292	Can I buy you a beer?
6295	6297	You got six bits. Yeah.
6298	6300	Can I have a couple of beers?
6305	6307	Does Julie ever mention me?
6319	6320	Taxi!
6327	6328	Thank you.
6361	6362	Hi.
6364	6366	I saw your father.
6368	6371	I drove up to see him in that bar he hangs out at.
6372	6373	He doesn't hang out there.
6373	6376	Oh, yeah. I forgot.
6377	6379	- How's Amy? - Fine.
6380	6384	Your dad and I had a couple of beers and shot a good game of pool.
6385	6387	We had a really good time together.
6390	6391	How's it going?
6394	6396	Terry Bishop's back on the show.
6396	6397	April lost her license...
6398	6401	- I meant with you. - I know what you meant.
6406	6408	So you're pretty hot after your unveiling.
6409	6410	What's your next triumph?
6410	6412	I'm going to do this play with...
6412	6414	Good. I've gotta catch a cab.
6416	6419	Can I call you sometime?
6424	6426	Look, I don't want to hold you up.
6427	6431	I just did it for the work. I didn't mean to hurt anybody.
6432	6433	Especially you.
6445	6446	I miss Dorothy.
6449	6451	You don't have to.
6451	6452	She's right here.
6455	6456	And she misses you.
6461	6463	Look, you don't know me from Adam.
6464	6468	But I was a better man with you, as a woman...
6468	6471	...than I ever was with a woman, as a man.
6471	6472	You know what I mean?
6475	6479	I just gotta learn to do it without the dress.
6483	6487	At this point, there might be an advantage to my wearing pants.
6493	6496	The hard part's over, you know?
6496	6498	We were already...
6499	6501	...good friends.
6510	6513	Will you loan me that little yellow outfit?
6515	6516	Which one?
6517	6519	- The Halston. - The Halston?
6519	6521	Oh, no!
6521	6523	You'll ruin it.
6524	6526	- You'll spill wine all over it. - I will not.
6527	6531	I'll loan it to you, but you gotta give it back. It's my favorite...
6531	6533	What are you gonna use it for?
