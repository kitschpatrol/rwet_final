171	173	Tracy!
173	175	Tracy!
190	191	Tracy!
191	193	- How do you spell "omelet"? - Oh, you.
193	198	Ninety-four for the ceremony and 506 for the reception.
198	200	I don't know where we'll put them if it rains.
200	202	It won't rain. Tracy won't stand for it.
202	206	- Mother, how do you spell "omelet"? - O-M-M-E-L-E-T.
206	210	- I thought there was another "L." - An omelet's a funny wedding present.
210	214	- It was a silver dish, dear. - Bring some of that junk off the table.
214	216	Be an angel and get these things out of the way.
216	218	Yes, darling.
223	224	This stinks.
225	227	Don't say "stinks," darling.
227	230	If absolutely necessary, "smells."
230	233	These cards have been changed again.
233	237	There must be a ghost in the house, the ghost of bridegroom number one.
237	239	Don't talk about Dexter as though he were dead.
239	242	- He may as well be, for all Tracy cares. - Right.
242	243	I wouldn't say that.
243	246	If I never see Mr. C.K. Dexter Haven again, I'll be...
246	248	- Isn't that awful? - They're friends of your father's.
248	253	What are they, tap dancers or just musical comedy producers?
253	255	That's hardly fair to your father's interest in the art.
255	260	Art, my eye! The art of putting up $100,000 to display the shapely legs...
260	262	- That will do, Tracy. - I give up.
265	268	If you'd just face the facts squarely, as I did...
268	272	We'd face the fact that neither of us has proved to be a success as a wife.
272	276	We just picked the wrong first husbands, that's all.
276	279	Don't let's argue about it. You wanted me to take a stand, so I did.
279	283	It's the only stand a woman could take and keep her self-respect.
283	284	Yes, dear, I know.
285	287	Now I have my self-respect and no husband.
287	291	You almost talk as though you wanted him back.
291	293	He wouldn't come back, probably.
293	296	Hey, it's better this way, really. You'll see.
296	300	Let's forget about the past. We both deserve some happiness, especially you.
300	302	- Darling. - Isn't George an angel?
302	304	- George is an angel. - Is he handsome or is he not?
305	306	George is handsome.
306	309	- I liked Dexter. - Why don't you postpone the wedding?
310	312	- How? - Get smallpox.
312	315	- Don't put the idea in her head. - George isn't usually late.
315	317	- He's waiting at the stables. - Waiting...
317	321	- lf I don't choke her before Saturday. - It'd postpone the wedding.
321	323	It would not. Be in the car when I get down.
324	326	She's so mean about Dexter.
326	328	He was rather mean to her.
328	330	- Did he really sock her? - Please, Dinah.
330	333	- Did he really? - Darling, go out and wait in the car.
333	336	- The papers were full of "innundo." - Of what?
336	339	Of "innundo." "Cruelty and drunkenness," it said.
341	345	Mother, why won't Tracy ask her own father to the wedding?
345	348	Your sister has very definite opinions about certain things.
348	349	She's sort of...
350	353	Well, you know, hard, isn't she?
353	354	Certainly not.
355	358	Tracy sets exceptionally high standards for herself, that's all...
358	361	and other people aren't always quite apt to live up to them.
362	366	But don't you think it's stinking not at least to want Father?
366	370	Yes, darling. Between ourselves, I think it's good and stinking.
371	374	Oh, I wish something would happen.
374	377	Nothing ever possibly in the least ever happens here.
379	380	Mother...
381	383	how do you get smallpox?
383	386	Oh, Dinah, please go. Go.
401	404	This is Uncle Willie's favorite: Complete Surrender.
429	432	Where'd you get this idiotic thing anyway?
435	438	Never play with fire, child, particularly on the eve of your wedding.
438	441	You're really a wicked old man, aren't you?
441	443	Who takes this, your cook?
443	445	I love it. It's got pictures of everything.
445	447	It certainly has.
447	447	It certainly has.
447	452	Who is that terribly attractive man? Can Tracy pick 'em, or can she?
452	454	- Lf you're asking me... - I'm not.
454	457	- Hello, darling. - Hello!
457	460	- How do you like me? - I adore you, but you look awful.
460	463	- Awful? - Like something out of a shop window.
467	469	Cut it out! They're new!
469	471	They're new, but they're not going to be.
471	474	- There, that's better. - I don't get it.
474	477	When I was a coal miner, I wanted enough money to buy clean clothes.
477	478	Now that I'm general manager...
479	482	Dinah, is there anything in there about the wedding?
482	484	- What do you mean? - I thought maybe...
484	487	you being one of the oldest families in Philadelphia...
487	489	and me getting fairly important myself...
489	493	it's luck, of course, but l... What's the matter?
493	495	"An average day in the life of a congressman.
495	498	"The congressman's wife. The kitchen, where is prepared...
498	500	"one banana, sliced, two fried eggs.
500	503	- "The congressman kisses his wife." - Lots of people like publicity.
503	507	Of all the filthy ideas, coming into a private house with a camera.
508	512	George Kittredge, you get on that horse. What do you think of that?
512	515	What would happen if someday I got into politics?
515	518	- You'd be elected President. - I don't know about that.
518	520	- I mean about publicity. - Not in my home.
520	522	You mean our home, don't you?
523	527	Sorry, darling. I mean very much our home.
535	537	Never mind, Eddie. I'll get up myself.
539	540	Steady, Bessie.
542	544	Whoa, Bessie. Whoa.
552	554	Steady, Bessie.
555	558	Grab the reins, George, with the left hand.
560	563	- Put salt on his tail. - Shut up.
563	564	Steady, Bessie.
565	567	There. Whoa, Bessie.
569	571	What's the matter, Bessie? You act worried.
571	573	Maybe it's because his name is Jack.
576	578	Hi-ho, Silver.
592	594	That does the trick. Hello, Joe.
594	595	- Hi, Mike. - I won't do it, Liz.
595	599	I'm gonna tell Sidney Kidd very plainly I'm a writer, not a society snoop.
600	602	- I'm gonna tell him just that. - Just that.
604	606	Let Kidd fire me!
606	610	Start writin' short stories again. That's what I should be doin'.
610	612	- I'm gonna tell him just that. - Just that.
618	619	Come in.
629	631	- I don't think you're being fair. - No?
631	634	You're treating me like you treat all your other writers.
636	638	You really hate me, don't you, Connor?
638	641	No. I don't like you very much, though.
642	645	You hate me, I trust, Miss lmbrie?
645	648	No. I can't afford to hate anybody. I'm only a photographer.
652	653	Ask him to wait.
654	658	Your assignment will be Spy's most sensational achievement:
658	660	Tracy Lord.
660	663	Big game hunting in Africa, fox hunting in Pennsylvania...
663	666	married on impulse and divorced in a rage...
666	669	and always unapproachable by the press.
669	671	"The Unapproachable Miss Lord."
672	675	"The Philadelphia Story."
675	678	"Closed were the portals of snobbish fox hunting." No.
678	681	"No hunter of foxes is Spy magazine."
681	684	Anyway, presented for the first time, quote:
684	688	"A wedding day inside mainline society."
688	692	"Or what the kitchen maid saw through the keyhole." Unquote.
692	694	Writing's your job. I'm only the publisher.
694	697	All right, publisher, take this. Quote:
697	701	"No hunter of buckshot in the rear is cagey, crafty Connor."
701	704	Unquote. Close paragraph.
704	706	Close job. Close bank account.
708	711	But how can we possibly get inside the Lord estate, let alone the house?
711	714	We're not gonna do it, doggone it!
714	716	It's degrading! It's undignified!
716	718	So is an empty stomach. How do we get in?
723	725	Ask the gentleman to come in.
735	738	- I understand we understand each other. - Quite.
738	741	This gentleman has been employed in our Buenos Aires office.
741	744	Fortunately, he came up yesterday on the clipper...
744	746	and I believe he can help us with our problem.
746	748	How?
748	751	Tracy Lord's brother Junius is in the American embassy down there...
751	754	and he's an old friend of this gentleman's.
754	757	He'll introduce you to the Lords as intimate friends of Junius.
757	759	Dear old Junius.
759	762	This Tracy Lord, does she know you?
762	764	You might say Miss Lord and I grew up together.
764	768	You might also say you were her first husband.
768	769	Yes, you might.
769	772	Holy mackerel. What goes on here?
772	776	I remember your honeymoon very well, you and she on a little sailboat.
776	779	- The True Love, wasn't it? - How did you know?
779	782	I was the only photographer whose camera you didn't smash.
782	785	You were terribly nice about it. You threw it in the ocean.
786	787	One of those, huh?
788	791	Yes, I had the strange idea our honeymoon was our own business.
791	795	Incidentally, he paid for the cameras. I got a nice letter of apology too.
795	797	Always the gentleman, huh?
797	799	Except on occasion.
799	801	Now, what are the plans?
801	804	The wedding's Saturday. Today is Thursday.
804	806	They should spend tomorrow night as guests of the Lords.
806	808	There's somethin' screwy here.
808	812	If you've resigned, why are you doin' all this unless you...
815	817	You wanna get even with your ex-bride, huh?
819	822	I'll have a car pick them up at noon tomorrow in north Philadelphia.
827	831	Mike, there's spit in your eye. It shows.
848	851	Maybe they'd rather we go around to the servants' entrance.
851	853	Maybe this is the servants' entrance.
861	865	- Good morning, Edward. - Why, Mr. Haven!
865	868	Is Mrs. Haven... I mean, Miss Tracy or her mother in?
868	872	They may be at the swimming pool, sir. Shall I announce you?
872	875	No. I'll go around myself and surprise them.
875	877	It will indeed be a surprise, sir.
877	880	These are friends of Mr. Junius's. Have them wait in the south parlor.
880	882	Certainly, Mr. Haven.
892	893	Excuse me, sir.
898	900	The south parlor?
900	902	Miss lmbrie, the south parlor.
903	907	The queen will have bread and honey at the usual time.
914	917	Seems a little cold for the south parlor.
918	921	I'd rather expected to find pickaninnies and banjos.
926	929	What's this room? I forgot my compass.
933	936	This would be south-southwest parlor by living room.
936	939	Knickknacks, gimcracks, signed photographs.
939	942	You'd have to be as rich as the Lords to live in a dump like this.
942	945	- I wouldn't live in it if they paid me. - They won't.
956	959	Looks like they run a hockshop on the side.
982	984	Just lookin' around.
1007	1009	I'll want your fingerprints for this.
1012	1016	Hey, what's this... What's this guy Haven up to?
1016	1018	C.K. Dexter Haven.
1018	1022	What kind of a name is that? C.K. Dexter Haven.
1022	1025	Macaulay Connor's no homespun tag, my pet.
1025	1027	Yeah, you just try callin' me Macaulay.
1027	1029	I knew a plain Joe Smith once.
1029	1033	He was only a clerk in a hardware store, but he was an absolute rat.
1036	1038	C.K. Dexter Haven.
1038	1042	He plays polo, he designs sailboats, "class" boats.
1042	1045	- Very upper class. - Don't despair.
1045	1047	He's out. Kittredge, man of the people, is in.
1047	1050	Quite a comer too, I understand. Political timber.
1050	1052	Poor guy. I wonder how he fell for it.
1053	1056	Uh-oh, Liz. What did I tell you? How do you like this?
1056	1060	"Living room, sitting room, terrace, pool, stables."
1060	1063	That's so they can talk to the horses without having them in the house.
1064	1065	Don't, Mike!
1072	1073	Yes?
1073	1075	This is the bridal suite.
1075	1077	Send up some caviar sandwiches and a bottle of beer.
1077	1079	What? Who is this?
1079	1082	This is the voice of doom calling.
1082	1086	Your days are numbered, to the seventh son of the seventh son!
1089	1092	- Hello? Hello? - What's the matter?
1092	1095	One of the servants has been at the sherry again.
1098	1101	- Dexter, you've come back! - Ah, Dinah, my dream girl!
1101	1103	What in the name of...
1105	1108	No, it can't be. He went to South America for two years.
1109	1111	Edward said they were at the swimming pool.
1111	1113	They seem to be here.
1116	1120	Dexter, don't you know that tomorrow is the wedding?
1120	1122	Oh, that's right. So it is.
1123	1126	You can go right back where you came from!
1127	1129	Can't. Dinah says it's awful here without me.
1129	1131	Hello, you sweet thing.
1131	1133	Red, you look in the pink.
1135	1137	You don't think I'd miss your wedding, do you?
1137	1141	- Dexter, you wouldn't. - I'm not so sure he wouldn't.
1141	1144	No, Mother Lord, I wouldn't. I assure you I wouldn't.
1144	1146	- Tell us all about Junius. - Stay 'til lunch.
1146	1150	Don't open your house. Stay here. We're having no guests over the wedding.
1152	1155	- How about the groom? - He's staying at the gatehouse.
1155	1156	Oh, that's good.
1156	1158	- Junius is fine. - He should be here.
1159	1161	He's heartbroken. I suggested representing him as best man...
1161	1165	I'm afraid that George might prefer to have his best man sober.
1165	1167	I wish you'd represent George.
1167	1170	That's my loyal little girl. You'll like the people Junius did send.
1170	1173	You haven't switched from liquor to dope, by any chance?
1173	1176	- You see? - The people Junius did send?
1176	1179	You don't know a Macaulay Connor or Elizabeth lmbrie, do you?
1179	1181	- We can finish these later. - I'd better introduce you.
1181	1185	Call me for... Introduce me to whom?
1185	1188	To Miss lmbrie and Mr. Connor, to tell them which rooms they'd have.
1188	1192	Mr. Connor is asking if he should wear a black or white tie to tonight's party.
1192	1196	- Rooms? - I'd better start from the beginning.
1196	1199	Sit down, dear. They're great friends of Junius's.
1199	1202	And they expect to stay here? I think that's very queer.
1202	1205	I think it's queerer than that. I think it's paranoiac.
1205	1208	You see, it was Junius's idea. They've been very kind to him, and...
1208	1211	You're lying, Dexter. I can always tell.
1211	1213	- Can you, Red? - They're Junius's friends.
1213	1216	You went to work after the divorce, didn't you?
1216	1219	Yes, except for a brief interlude in some alcoholic sanitariums.
1219	1221	You took a job in South America. Who for?
1221	1224	- A magazine. - It wasn't Spy magazine?
1224	1226	You are a mass of intuition.
1226	1229	I don't suppose that Junius's friends are photographers?
1229	1231	- I thought you were low, but I never... - What are you going to do?
1231	1234	- After I've telephoned Junius... - Wait, Red.
1234	1236	Don't telephone Junius. I'll confess.
1242	1244	No. You're slipping, Red.
1244	1248	I used to be afraid of that look, the withering glance of the goddess.
1248	1251	I didn't think that alcohol would... Oh, shut up.
1254	1255	Dinah, stay here.
1255	1258	Please, Mother. Maybe he's going to sock her.
1258	1262	Don't say "sock," darling. "Strike" is quite an ugly enough word.
1263	1266	Who do they think they are, barging in on peaceful people?
1266	1270	- They'll think you don't want them. - I want them out, and you too!
1270	1273	Yes, your majesty. But first could I interest you in some small blackmail?
1275	1279	It's an article, complete with snapshots, details and insinuations...
1279	1281	and it's ready for publication in Spy...
1281	1284	and it's about your father and that dancer in New York.
1284	1286	About Father and Tina Mara?
1286	1288	Quiet. Dinah.
1288	1292	But they can't, even if it's true.
1293	1296	- Where do you get these? - From Sidney Kidd, editor and publisher.
1296	1299	- He's got to be stopped. - He is, temporarily.
1299	1303	That is, if you'll allow those two to turn in the story on your wedding.
1303	1306	And when Kidd says a story, he means a story.
1306	1308	- I'm gonna be sick. - Yes, dear.
1308	1311	"An Intimate Day With a Society Bride."
1311	1312	I am sick.
1313	1315	It's tough, but that's the way it seems to be.
1315	1318	So I'm to be examined, undressed and generally humiliated...
1318	1320	at 15 cents a copy.
1320	1323	And you, you... You're loving it.
1323	1325	Am I, Red?
1331	1332	Mother, we're hooked.
1332	1335	- Are they really reporters? - Not even friends of Junius's?
1335	1337	They aren't anybody's friends, but we're to pretend they are.
1337	1339	- But why? - Don't ask me.
1339	1341	There's a good reason, and it's my wedding, so please!
1342	1344	I'll bet it's on account of Father and that dancer.
1344	1347	- Dinah, what do you know? - I listen around.
1347	1349	Is there no such thing as privacy anymore?
1349	1352	Only in bed, Mother, and not always there.
1352	1354	Watching every little mannerism...
1354	1357	jotting down notes on how we sit, stand, talk, eat and move!
1357	1361	- Will they do that? - All in that horrible, snide English.
1361	1364	If we have to submit to it to save Father's face...
1364	1366	which, incidentally, doesn't deserve it...
1366	1370	I'll give them a picture of home life that'll stand their hair on end!
1371	1375	Tracy, we must just be ourselves, very much ourselves.
1375	1378	But you want us to create a good impression, don't you?
1378	1380	They don't know that we know what they're here for?
1380	1382	No. That was understood. The girl's quite nice.
1382	1385	He writes short stories. Very down to earth.
1385	1388	- They'll love us. - Oh, dear, you'd both better dress.
1388	1392	And both of you, promise to behave like ladies in front of these creatures.
1392	1395	We'll do our best, Mrs. Lord. I don't know how good that is.
1400	1403	Dexter, how perfectly dreadful.
1403	1407	What'll they say about Seth not being here for his own daughter's wedding?
1410	1411	I know, dear.
1415	1419	You'd better go and tell them how terribly happy we are to have them.
1419	1421	That's the old Quaker spirit, Mother Lord.
1421	1423	Keep swinging.
1430	1432	Oh. I thought it was that butler.
1433	1435	The family will be down to welcome you.
1435	1437	- What with? - With open arms.
1437	1439	They're terribly happy to have any friends of Junius's here.
1440	1442	- Do they know about us? - Why should they?
1442	1446	Look, Haven, our research department didn't give us much data.
1446	1450	This fiancé of this girl, George Kittredge, age 32?
1450	1452	- You know him very well? - Well enough.
1452	1457	"General manager of Quaker State Coal, company owned by Seth Lord."
1457	1460	- That's the girl's father, huh? - What a coincidence.
1460	1461	How'd he meet her?
1461	1464	Heaven brought them together, I imagine.
1466	1467	"Seth Lord.
1467	1470	"See Banker's Annual, Directory of Directors."
1470	1472	- Is there a library in town? - Yes.
1472	1474	I suppose you wouldn't know where that is?
1474	1477	Well, roughly. My grandfather built it.
1480	1483	Now, about this girl...
1483	1486	"Tracy Samantha Lord."
1486	1487	What about her?
1487	1490	Well, what's her leading characteristic?
1490	1493	She has a horror of men who wear their hats in the house.
1495	1498	Leading characteristics to be filled in later.
1498	1500	I can fill them in right now.
1500	1504	The young, rich, rapacious American female.
1504	1506	No other country where she exists.
1506	1509	And would I change places with Tracy Samantha Lord...
1509	1511	for all her wealth and beauty?
1511	1514	Oh, boy, just ask me.
1515	1518	Well, tell four footmen to call me in time for lunch, will you?
1527	1529	How do you do?
1530	1532	Friends of my brother Junius, are you not?
1532	1534	I am Dinah Lord.
1534	1536	My real name is Diana, but my sister changed it.
1536	1538	I'm Elizabeth lmbrie. This is Macaulay Connor.
1538	1543	Enchantée de vous voir! Enchantée de faire votre connaissance!
1543	1545	I spoke French before I spoke English.
1545	1548	My early childhood was spent in Paris where my father worked in a bank:
1548	1550	- The House of Morgan. - Really?
1550	1552	C'est vrai absolument!
1552	1556	Can you play the piano? I can, and sing at the same time!
1556	1557	Listen.
1567	1569	Lydia, oh, Lydia Say, have you met Lydia
1569	1572	Oh, Lydia the tattooed lady
1573	1575	She has eyes that folks adore so
1575	1579	And a torso even more so
1579	1581	What is this?
1581	1582	Idiot, probably.
1582	1584	The queen of tattoos
1584	1587	On her back is the battle of Waterloo
1588	1590	Beside it the wreck of the Hesperus too
1590	1594	And proudly above waves the red, white
1594	1596	And blue
1596	1600	You can learn a lot from Lydia
1600	1603	Ah, petite soeur, tu es un véritable petit Chopin!
1603	1605	- Tu trouves? - Mais certainement.
1605	1608	Mais qu'est-ce qu'il y a? Voyons, tu es pâle.
1608	1612	Montre-moi ta langue. J'espere bien que ce n'est pas le smallpox.
1612	1613	- Le smallpox? - Mais oui.
1613	1615	Va dire a maman de se dépecher!
1620	1623	Oh. How do you do?
1625	1627	I'm Tracy Lord.
1627	1630	It's so nice having you here. How did you leave Junius?
1630	1632	We left Junius fine. That little sister of yours...
1632	1634	Isn't she a dear? So talented.
1634	1638	- Junius is such a lamb, isn't he? - Yes, isn't he?
1638	1642	It's a pity none of the male members of the family are going to be here.
1642	1645	- Where's your father? - Darling Papa.
1645	1648	- I do hope you'll stay for my wedding. - We'd like to very much.
1648	1651	- That was our idea. - I'm so glad that it occurred to you.
1651	1654	The house is in rather a mess, of course.
1654	1658	We'll all have to huddle here and overflow onto the porch.
1660	1664	- I hope your rooms are comfortable. - Your father sick?
1665	1668	- What a cunning little camera. - I'm an awful nuisance with it.
1669	1671	But you couldn't be. I hope you'll take loads.
1671	1674	Dear Papa and Mama aren't allowing any reporters in.
1674	1678	That is, except for little Mr. Grace, who does the social news.
1678	1681	Can you imagine a grown-up man having to sink so low?
1681	1683	It does seem kind of bad.
1685	1687	You're a kind of writer...
1687	1690	- aren't you, Mr. Connor? - Sort of.
1690	1691	- A book? - Yes.
1691	1694	Under what name do you publish?
1694	1697	My own. Macaulay Connor.
1698	1700	What's the Macaulay for?
1700	1703	Well, my father taught English history.
1703	1705	I'm "Mike" to my friends.
1705	1708	Of whom you have many, I'm sure.
1708	1710	English history, it's always fascinated me:
1710	1713	Cromwell, Robin Hood, Jack the Ripper.
1713	1716	Where did he teach? I mean, your father.
1716	1718	In a little high school in South Bend, Indiana.
1718	1720	South Bend.
1720	1722	It sounds like dancing, doesn't it?
1722	1725	You must have had a most happy childhood there.
1725	1727	- Yeah, it was terrific. - I'm so glad.
1727	1730	- I didn't mean it that way. - I'm so sorry. Why?
1730	1733	Well, lack of wherewithal, I guess.
1733	1737	But that doesn't always cause unhappiness, does it?
1737	1738	Not if you're the right kind of man.
1738	1742	George Kittredge, my fiancé, never had anything either, and he...
1742	1743	Are either of you married?
1747	1748	You mean you were, but now you're divorced.
1749	1751	- The fact is... - Surely you're not ashamed of it.
1751	1754	- Of course I'm not. - What?
1754	1757	It was years ago. I was only a kid in Duluth.
1757	1759	Good heavens, Liz. You never told me.
1759	1762	- You never asked me. - I know, but you...
1764	1765	Joe Smith, hardware.
1767	1770	You're the darnedest girl, Liz.
1770	1772	I think I'm sweet.
1774	1777	Duluth must be a lovely spot. It's west of here, isn't it?
1777	1780	Sort of, but occasionally we get the breezes...
1780	1782	And this is your first visit in Philadelphia.
1782	1785	It's a quaint old place, don't you think? Filled with relics.
1785	1787	And how old are you, Mr. Connor?
1787	1788	Thirty.
1788	1790	One book isn't much for a man of 30.
1790	1792	I don't mean to criticize.
1792	1794	You probably have other interests outside your work.
1794	1796	None.
1796	1798	I mean us.
1799	1800	How sweet.
1800	1803	Are you going together?
1805	1808	- I beg your pardon? - That is an odd question.
1808	1811	I don't see why. I think it's very interesting.
1812	1815	Miss lmbrie, don't you agree...
1815	1817	that if a man says he loves a girl, he ought to marry her?
1817	1819	Can she be human?
1819	1821	Please, Mr. Connor. I asked Miss lmbrie a question.
1822	1823	Well, that depends. L...
1823	1825	I'll see what's keeping Mama.
1835	1837	Who's doing the interviewing here?
1838	1842	- You don't suppose she caught on? - No, she was born that way.
1842	1844	- Don't let her throw ya. - Do you want to take over?
1844	1847	- I wanna go home. - Ah, here you are.
1847	1850	How do you do? We're so happy to have you.
1850	1853	Forgive me for not coming in sooner, but things are in such a state.
1853	1855	My little girl.
1856	1858	She's going to leave me.
1858	1862	Aren't you pretty, my dear. But then Junius's friends always are.
1862	1864	Look at the way she wears her hair, Tracy.
1864	1867	- Isn't it pretty? - Mighty fine.
1869	1871	Shall we have sherry on the porch?
1878	1881	- This is my youngest daughter, Diana. - I think we've met.
1881	1884	I wish my husband could be here. We expect him presently.
1884	1888	He's detained in New York on business for that lovely dancer, Tina Mara.
1888	1890	- Do you know her work? - Not professionally.
1890	1892	So talented, and such a lovely person...
1892	1895	but like so many artists, no business head.
1895	1896	None whatever.
1897	1899	I have some lovely presents, don't you think so, Mr. Connor?
1910	1911	Hello, everybody.
1913	1916	- I hope I'm not late. - You're never late, George.
1916	1921	We have a lovely surprise. Junius has sent these people as a wedding present.
1921	1924	Mr. Kittredge, this is Miss... I'm so sorry.
1924	1926	- Imbrie. - Any friend of Junius's is my friend.
1926	1928	And, uh, Mr. Morrow?
1928	1930	- I didn't get the name. - Connor.
1930	1932	Macauley Connor.
1932	1933	He's a writer.
1934	1935	Don't apologize, Mrs. Lord.
1935	1937	No apology necessary. I have great respect for writers.
1937	1939	Well, thank you. Any kind word is...
1940	1942	- How are you? - Much better now that you're here.
1942	1944	Oh, I guess this must be love, huh?
1944	1948	- Your guess is correct. - I'm just his faithful old dog Tray.
1948	1950	- Give me your paw. - You've got it.
1951	1953	How sweet.
1954	1956	Say, I'd like to see one of those, Miss lmbrie.
1956	1957	You will.
1957	1959	Shall we have some sherry?
1959	1962	I suppose Junius has told you all about our happy little family.
1962	1965	- Papa! - What?
1966	1969	Dear Papa.
1971	1974	You angel to get here in time for lunch!
1974	1976	- Isn't he, Mama? - Indeed he is, but...
1976	1978	Father, these are our friends, Miss lmbrie and Mr. Connor.
1979	1983	- How are you, Mr. Lord? - Oh, just fine, thank you.
1983	1985	- How are you? - How do you do?
1985	1986	How do you do?
1986	1987	Howdy, Pops.
1988	1989	Oh, dear Dinah.
1990	1993	- Father, here's George. - How are you, Kittredge?
1993	1994	Margaret, my sweet.
1994	1998	- Another place for luncheon, Edward. - Very good, madam.
1999	2001	Well... here I am...
2001	2003	in the bosom of my...
2003	2006	- Hello, friends and enemies. - Young man!
2007	2009	- Remove yourself. - How are you, sir?
2009	2011	I don't know. Get along.
2012	2013	Darling, I've changed my mind. I will stay for lunch.
2014	2015	Another place, Edward.
2015	2018	- Hello, Kittredge. - How are you, Haven?
2018	2019	Just Damon and Pythias.
2019	2022	No, Grant and Lee.
2029	2031	You don't look as well as when I last saw you, Kittredge.
2032	2034	Oh, you poor fellow. I know just how you feel.
2036	2038	- How's it coming? - Beautifully, Dexter.
2038	2042	We're so indebted to you for these lovely people.
2042	2044	It's almost impossible to repay that debt.
2045	2046	But you'll manage, eh, Red?
2048	2051	- They grew up together, you know. - How nice.
2051	2053	You don't look old enough to get married...
2054	2056	not even the first time, but then you never did.
2056	2059	She needs trouble to mature her, Kittredge. Give her lots of it.
2059	2061	I'm afraid she can't count on me for that.
2061	2063	No? That's too bad.
2063	2066	For your own sake, Red, you should have stuck to me longer.
2066	2069	I thought it was for life, but the nice judge gave me a full pardon.
2069	2072	Ah, that's the old redhead. No bitterness, no recrimination.
2072	2074	Just a good swift left to the jaw.
2078	2080	They grew up together.
2082	2084	Luncheon is served, madam.
2084	2088	Oh, thank you, Edward. Come sit. We have so much to talk about.
2088	2092	I don't suppose a man ever had a better or finer family.
2093	2095	I often wake up in the night and say to myself...
2095	2098	"Seth, you lucky dog, what have you done to deserve it all?"
2098	2100	And what have you?
2105	2106	Oh, thank you.
2109	2112	Oh, how stupid of me!
2113	2116	Oh, dear! How awful!
2116	2118	I had a feeling that would happen.
2118	2121	Your camera. I'm so, so sorry.
2121	2123	I'm sure you are.
2129	2131	What is it?
2131	2132	Your father.
2134	2135	Uncle Willie!
2138	2141	- Uncle Willie, how nice. - I beg your pardon.
2141	2144	Please go on into lunch, everyone. I want a word with Uncle Willie.
2145	2147	- Another place, Edward. - Yes, madam.
2153	2155	I'm afraid I don't understand.
2155	2158	You never have, but you came anyway, didn't you?
2158	2163	Oh. Still Justice with her shining sword, eh, daughter?
2163	2166	- Who's on the spot? - We are, thanks to you...
2166	2167	Uncle Willie.
2174	2175	How long will you be researching?
2175	2179	Not long if I can find the right books... his family history and stuff like that.
2179	2181	There's a cousin Joanna that's definitely crazy.
2181	2182	- Who told you? - Dinah.
2182	2185	- Dinah should know. - Come across the street when you finish.
2185	2187	- Miss Hobson's establishment. - Okay.
2215	2216	What does thee wish?
2216	2218	I'm looking for some local b...
2221	2224	- What'd you say? - What does thee wish?
2226	2229	Um, local biography or history.
2229	2232	If thee will, consult with my colleague in there.
2237	2239	Dost thou have a washroom?
2241	2242	Thank thee.
2263	2266	I know this is a public library, but I wou...
2266	2268	- Hello. - Hello.
2271	2274	Couldn't you afford to buy my book?
2274	2275	The bookstore didn't have one.
2275	2278	Are you sure you're doing the right thing?
2278	2280	You know what happens to girls like you when they read books like mine.
2280	2283	They begin to think. That's bad.
2283	2285	These stories are beautiful.
2285	2287	Why, Connor, they're almost poetry.
2288	2291	Don't kid yourself. They are.
2291	2294	I can't make you out at all now.
2294	2297	Really? I thought I was easy.
2297	2300	So did I, but you're not.
2302	2305	You talk so big and tough, and then you write like this.
2306	2308	Which is which?
2310	2311	Both, I guess.
2313	2317	No, I believe you put the toughness on to save your skin.
2319	2321	You think so?
2321	2323	I know a little about that.
2324	2326	- Do you? - Quite a lot.
2330	2332	Let's get out of here.
2339	2344	This book was just such a complete surprise to me.
2344	2347	L... let's walk, shall we? Lt'll be much more fun.
2347	2349	Take this. Tell Mr. Kittredge we'll meet him at the pool.
2349	2351	Yes, Miss Tracy.
2354	2358	The story called, "With The Rich and Mighty," I think I liked it best.
2358	2361	I got it from a Spanish peasant's proverb.
2361	2364	"With the rich and mighty, always a little patience."
2364	2365	I like that.
2368	2370	What's the matter? A little too rough?
2370	2372	A little...
2372	2374	but I'm used to it.
2376	2378	Tell me something, will you?
2378	2382	When you can do a thing like that book, how can you possibly do anything else?
2382	2386	You may not believe this, but there are people that must earn their living.
2386	2388	Of course, but people buy books, don't they?
2389	2390	Not as long as there's a library around.
2392	2395	That book of mine represents two solid years' work...
2395	2399	and it netted Connor something under $600.
2399	2402	- But that shouldn't be. - Unhappily it is.
2402	2405	This is beautiful country around here. What is it all, anyway?
2405	2408	Part of our place. What about your Miss lmbrie?
2408	2410	Well, Miss lmbrie's in somewhat the same fix.
2411	2413	She's a born painter and might be a very important one...
2413	2417	but Miss lmbrie must eat, and she also prefers a roof over her head...
2417	2420	to being constantly out in the rain and snow.
2420	2421	Food and a roof.
2424	2427	You've really got something here.
2427	2428	- Where? - All this.
2429	2432	Oh. Come on. The dressing rooms are over here.
2434	2436	I think you'll find everything you need.
2439	2443	Use any old one, but I think you'll find most of the junk in there.
2443	2445	- Yell if you need anything. - Okay.
2462	2464	I have an idea.
2465	2468	I have the most wonderful little house in Uniondale.
2469	2473	It's up on a hill with a view that would knock you silly.
2473	2475	I'm never there except in the hunting season...
2475	2478	and not much then, and I'd be so happy to know...
2478	2481	that it was of some real use to someone.
2484	2486	- Can you hear me? - Yeah.
2487	2490	There's a brook and a small lake...
2490	2491	no size, really...
2492	2495	and a patch of woods, and in any kind of weather...
2495	2497	it's the most wonderful...
2497	2501	Well, anyhow, I'm so delighted that I can offer it to you.
2502	2505	Well, it's terribly nice of you, but, uh...
2508	2509	Heck, that's Dexter.
2510	2514	Look, if he comes here, stand by, will you?
2514	2516	- I don't want to be alone with him. - Certainly, if you like.
2516	2519	Isn't it lucky that I happened to think about that house?
2519	2522	And don't think I'd come trooping in every minute, because I wouldn't.
2522	2525	I'd never come except when expressly asked to.
2525	2529	- Well, it isn't that. - What is it?
2529	2531	Well, you see, the idea of artists...
2531	2535	depending upon a patron lady bountiful has more or less gone out.
2536	2539	Oh. I see.
2541	2545	That wasn't especially kind of you, Mr. Connor.
2545	2548	I'm sorry to have seemed patronizing.
2548	2550	- Now, look, I didn't mean... - Please don't bother.
2556	2559	- Hello. - Hello. Fancy seeing you here.
2559	2561	Orange juice? Certainly.
2561	2564	Don't tell me you've forsaken your beloved whiskey and whiskeys.
2564	2567	No, I've just changed their color.
2567	2570	I'm going for the pale pastel shades. They're more becoming to me.
2570	2572	How about you, Mr. Connor? You drink, don't you?
2572	2574	- Alcohol, I mean. - A little.
2574	2577	A little? And you're a writer?
2577	2580	Tsk, tsk, tsk. I thought all writers drank to excess and beat their wives.
2580	2584	You know, at one time I think I secretly wanted to be a writer.
2585	2589	Dexter, would you mind doing something for me?
2589	2591	- Anything. What? - Get the heck out of here.
2591	2592	I couldn't do that.
2592	2594	That wouldn't be fair to you. You need me too much.
2594	2597	Would you tell me what you're hanging around for?
2597	2600	- No, please don't go, Mr. Connor. - No, please don't go, Mr. Connor.
2600	2603	As a writer, this ought to be right up your street.
2603	2604	Don't miss a word.
2605	2609	I never saw you looking better, Red. You're getting that fine, tawny look.
2609	2613	Oh, we're going to talk about me, are we? Goody.
2613	2616	It's astonishing what money can do for people, don't you agree, Mr. Connor?
2616	2619	Not too much, you know. Just more than enough.
2620	2622	Take Tracy, for example.
2622	2624	There was never a blow that hasn't been softened for her.
2624	2627	Never a blow that won't be softened. It's even changed her shape.
2627	2632	- She was once a dumpy little thing. - I'm not interested in myself now.
2632	2635	Not interested in yourself? You're fascinated, Red.
2635	2637	You're far and away your favorite person in the world.
2637	2639	- In case you don't know... - Of course, Mr. Connor...
2639	2642	she's a girl who's generous to a fault.
2642	2643	To a fault, Mr. Connor.
2643	2645	Except to other people's faults.
2646	2648	For instance, she never had any understanding...
2648	2649	of my deep and gorgeous thirst.
2649	2652	- That was your problem. - Granted.
2652	2655	But you took on that problem with me when you took me, Red.
2655	2657	You were no helpmate there. You were a scold.
2657	2660	It was disgusting. It made you so unattractive.
2660	2663	A weakness, sure, and strength is her religion, Mr. Connor.
2663	2666	She finds human imperfection unforgivable.
2667	2669	When I discovered that my relationship to her...
2669	2673	was supposed to be not that of a loving husband and a good companion but...
2674	2676	- Oh, never mind. - Say it.
2677	2680	But that of a kind of high priest to a virgin goddess.
2681	2684	Then my drinks grew deeper and more frequent.
2685	2688	I never considered you as that nor myself.
2688	2690	You did it without knowing it.
2690	2695	And the night that you got drunk on champagne and climbed out on the roof...
2695	2698	and stood there, naked, with your arms out to the moon...
2698	2700	wailing like a banshee.
2701	2704	I never had the slightest recollection of doing any such thing.
2704	2707	You drew a blank. You wanted to.
2707	2709	Mr. Connor, what would you... oh.
2711	2713	A nice story for Spy, incidentally.
2713	2715	Yes. Too bad we can't supply photographs of you on the roof.
2715	2718	Honestly, the fuss you made over that silly, childish epis...
2718	2721	It was enormously important and most revealing.
2721	2724	The moon is also a goddess, chaste and virginal.
2724	2727	Stop using those foul words.
2727	2730	What are you trying to make me out as?
2730	2733	- What do you fancy yourself as? - I don't know that I fancy myself...
2733	2735	When I read you're gonna marry Kittredge I couldn't believe it.
2735	2737	That's why I'm here. How could he even think of it?
2737	2739	Because he's everything you're not.
2739	2742	He's been poor, he's had to work, and he's had to fight for everything...
2742	2746	and I love him as I never even began to love you.
2746	2749	Maybe so, but I doubt it. It's just a swing from me...
2749	2751	but it's too violent a swing.
2751	2753	Kittredge is no great tower of strength.
2753	2755	He's just a tower.
2755	2757	You hardly know him.
2757	2759	To hardly know him is to know him well.
2759	2762	Perhaps it offends my vanity to have anyone who was even remotely my wife...
2762	2764	remarry so obviously beneath her.
2766	2770	How dare you, in this day and age, use such an idiotic...
2770	2773	I'm talking about the difference in mind and spirit.
2773	2776	You could marry Mac, the night watchman. I'd cheer for you.
2776	2779	- Kittredge is not for you. - You bet he's for me.
2779	2781	He's a great man and a good man.
2781	2784	Already he's of national importance.
2784	2786	You sound like Spy magazine talking.
2786	2789	But whatever he is, toots, you'll have to stick.
2789	2792	- He'll give you no out as I did. - I won't require one.
2796	2799	I suppose you'd still be attractive to any man of spirit, though.
2799	2802	There's something engaging about it, this "goddess" business...
2802	2806	something more challenging to the male than the more obvious charms.
2806	2808	- Really? - Really.
2808	2810	We're very vain, you know.
2810	2813	"This citadel can and shall be taken, and I'm the boy to do it."
2815	2818	You seem quite contemptuous of me all of a sudden.
2820	2822	No, Red, not of you.
2822	2823	Never of you.
2827	2831	Red, you could be the finest woman on this earth.
2831	2834	I'm contemptuous of something inside you you either can't help or won't try to.
2834	2836	Your so-called "strength"...
2836	2839	your prejudice against weakness, your blank intolerance.
2839	2842	- Is that all? - That's the gist of it.
2842	2846	Because you'll never be a first-class human being or a first-class woman...
2846	2848	until you've learned to have regard for human frailty.
2849	2852	It's a pity your own foot can't slip a little sometime...
2852	2855	but your sense of inner divinity wouldn't allow that.
2855	2858	This goddess must and shall remain intact.
2860	2862	There are more of you than people realize.
2862	2865	A special class of the American female. "The Married Maidens."
2866	2867	So help me, if you say another word...
2868	2870	I'm through, Red. For the moment I've had my say.
2871	2873	I suppose I should object to this twosome.
2873	2875	That would be most objectionable.
2878	2880	Any time either of you want my advice...
2880	2883	- We'll give you a ring. - Thanks. Do that, will you?
2888	2890	So long, Red.
2890	2895	I left you a wedding present. Sorry I hadn't ribbon to tie it up with.
2919	2921	Aren't you swimming?
2921	2923	We haven't time. Uncle Willie wants us at 8:00.
2926	2929	Look what your friend considers a wedding present.
2931	2934	- Why, it's a model of the True Love. - The what?
2935	2938	A boat he designed and built, practically.
2938	2942	We sailed it down the coast of Maine and back the summer we were married.
2942	2944	My, she was yare!
2944	2945	"Yare"? What's that mean?
2945	2948	It means, uh... Oh, what does it mean?
2950	2953	Easy to handle, quick to the helm. Fast, bright.
2954	2956	Everything a boat should be...
2956	2958	until she develops dry rot.
2965	2968	Oh, George, to get away.
2969	2971	Somehow to be useful in the world.
2971	2973	Useful? You, Tracy?
2973	2976	I'm gonna build you an ivory tower with my own two hands.
2977	2979	Like fun you are.
2979	2981	You mean you've been in one too long?
2982	2986	Well, I mean that and a lot of things.
2997	2999	You know, we're gonna represent something, Tracy...
2999	3002	you and I and our home.
3002	3005	Something straight, sound and fine.
3005	3009	Then perhaps Mr. Haven will be somewhat less condescending.
3015	3018	You don't really mind him, do you?
3019	3021	I mean the fact of him?
3021	3023	"Fact of him"? What do you mean?
3023	3025	I mean... Well, you know.
3025	3027	That he ever was my lord and master.
3027	3029	That we ever were...
3029	3031	I don't believe he ever was, Tracy.
3031	3032	Not really.
3032	3036	I don't believe that anyone ever was or ever will be.
3036	3039	That's the wonderful thing about you, Tracy.
3039	3040	What? How?
3040	3045	You're like some marvelous, distant, well, queen, I guess.
3045	3048	You're so cool and fine and always so much your own.
3048	3052	There's a kind of beautiful purity about you, Tracy, like a statue.
3052	3054	- George... - It's grand, Tracy.
3054	3056	It's what everybody feels about you.
3056	3058	It's what I first worshipped you for from afar.
3058	3061	- George, listen. - First, now and always.
3063	3065	Only from a little nearer now, eh, darling?
3065	3070	L... I don't want to be worshipped. I want to be loved.
3070	3073	Well, you're that too, Tracy. You're that, all right.
3073	3076	I mean really loved.
3076	3079	But that goes without saying, Tracy.
3079	3083	No. No, now it's you who doesn't see what I mean.
3088	3090	I'd better get dressed. I hate to be late.
3098	3101	Oh, nothing. Run along. I'll be dressed when you get back.
3143	3146	You're Uncle Willie's guest of honor. You mustn't be late.
3146	3148	That fiancé of yours roared out of here on two wheels.
3149	3151	Does he, by any chance, ever walk anywhere?
3151	3153	When he likes, I expect.
3153	3156	I have a feeling he'll take that ring tomorrow and go through center with it.
3156	3158	Seth, you idiot!
3160	3162	Very amusing, I'm sure.
3162	3165	Almost as amusing as the sight of you with your arm around Mother.
3167	3169	I find very unamusing...
3169	3171	the stupid, undignified spectacle we're making of ourselves...
3172	3174	for the benefit of those two newspaper people.
3174	3175	Whose fault is it?
3176	3179	That's not the point. They can publish anything they like about me...
3179	3181	but I insist that we inform Connor and the camera lady...
3182	3184	that we're all aware of their purpose here.
3184	3186	All right. I'll tell them myself.
3188	3192	It'd look better coming from me as the titular head of the family.
3192	3195	Of course, inasmuch as you've let us in for it in the first place!
3195	3197	Keep that note out of your voice. It's very unattractive.
3198	3202	Oh? How does your dancer friend talk, or does she purr?
3202	3204	- Tracy! - It's quite all right.
3204	3207	Sweet and low, I suppose. Dulcet. Very ladylike.
3207	3210	You've got nerve to come back here in your best head-of-the-family manner...
3210	3214	and make stands and strike attitudes and criticize my fiancé...
3214	3216	and give orders and mess things up generally.
3216	3218	- Stop it instantly! - I can't help it! It's sickening!
3219	3222	- As if he'd done nothing at all. - Which happens to be the truth.
3222	3225	Anyway, it's not your affair. If it concerns anyone...
3227	3229	Well, actually, I don't know who it concerns except your father.
3231	3234	That's very wise of you, Margaret.
3234	3237	What most wives fail to realize is that their husbands' philandering...
3237	3239	has nothing whatever to do with them.
3239	3242	Oh? Then what has it to do with?
3243	3247	A reluctance to grow old, I think.
3247	3250	I suppose the best mainstay a man can have as he gets along in years...
3250	3252	is a daughter.
3252	3254	The right kind of daughter.
3254	3256	How sweet.
3256	3259	No, I'm talking seriously about something I've thought over thoroughly.
3259	3260	I've had to.
3260	3262	A devoted young girl gives a man the illusion...
3262	3264	that youth is still his.
3264	3267	- Very important, I suppose. - Oh, very, very.
3267	3271	Because, without her, he might be inclined to go in search of his youth.
3271	3274	That's just as important to him as it is to any woman.
3274	3277	But with a girl of his own, full of warmth for him...
3277	3280	full of foolish, unquestioning, uncritical affection...
3280	3283	- None of which I've got. - None.
3283	3285	You have a good mind, a pretty face...
3285	3287	a disciplined body that does what you tell it.
3288	3292	You have everything it takes to make a lovely woman except the one essential.
3292	3294	An understanding heart.
3294	3297	Without that, you might as well be made of bronze.
3300	3303	That's an awful thing to say to anyone.
3304	3306	Yes, it is indeed.
3309	3312	So I'm to blame for Tina Mara, am I?
3312	3315	- To a certain extent, I expect you are. - You coward!
3316	3320	But better that than a prig or a perennial spinster...
3320	3322	however many marriages.
3322	3324	- Seth, that's too much. - I'm afraid it's not enough.
3324	3326	I'm afraid nothing is.
3326	3330	- What did you say I was? - Do you want me to repeat it?
3333	3335	A prig and a...
3337	3341	You mean you think I think I'm some kind of a goddess or something?
3341	3344	If your ego wants it that way, yes.
3344	3347	Also, you've been talking like a jealous woman.
3352	3355	What's the matter with everyone all at once, anyhow?
3356	3359	I've been asleep. What time is it?
3359	3361	- After 7:00. - Call my house.
3362	3364	Tell them I'm on my way. You'd better come along too.
3364	3367	You're the host tonight, you know? Uncle Willie.
3367	3370	That's all over. You're yourself again. So am I.
3370	3372	- You've told them? - I shall at the first opportunity.
3374	3376	My first party, and about time.
3376	3378	- Can I have a cocktail? - Certainly not!
3378	3382	- It's a dirty gyp. - That dress hikes up a little behind.
3382	3385	- No, it's me that does. - You look adorable, Dinah.
3385	3387	Oh, thanks, Tracy. Thanks ever so much.
3387	3389	Tracy, you must dress.
3389	3392	Let's all have a last drink. I'm sorry. I forgot. You never drink.
3392	3394	- Prigs don't. - What's that?
3394	3396	- Nor spinsters. - Again, please?
3396	3398	Nor goddesses of any variety.
3399	3402	Not completely. Just a borderline case.
3403	3405	Miss lmbrie and I have something on our minds.
3405	3407	Splendid. Just the place for it. What?
3407	3411	- We'd like to say something. - I'm all ears and eyes.
3413	3416	You're a vision of loveliness, Miss lmbrie.
3416	3418	Will you have a cocktail or champagne?
3418	3420	Oh, champagne. I've never had enough.
3420	3422	You will, tonight.
3426	3428	- I'd like to say... - I have something to say first.
3428	3432	- I am Seth Lord. - No!
3432	3435	- Then that makes you... - Available.
3435	3437	And you are Miss lmbrie of Spy magazine.
3438	3441	- Now you know. - I was going to tell you...
3441	3444	- As to the reasons... - Not now. We ought to be early.
3444	3448	And who'll go with me in my little car?
3448	3452	Dinah and I. Seth, will you take Miss lmbrie and Mr. O'Connor? Dinah?
3453	3457	I can tell there's something in the air, because I'm being taken away.
3459	3462	Well, I'll see you all later.
3463	3465	Don't do that. What's the matter?
3465	3467	Nothing.
3467	3468	Miss lmbrie?
3470	3474	You know, I felt exactly as though I'd been pinched.
3474	3476	Don't you think you weren't.
3482	3484	You aren't even dressed.
3484	3486	Um, you go ahead.
3486	3490	I'll, uh, follow along with George.
3490	3492	What's the matter with Tracy?
3492	3494	You tell me, will you?
3494	3498	Darned if I know. I'd like to.
3498	3502	Well, Macaulay, if you ever happen to find out...
3502	3504	I'll tell you. Sure.
3504	3507	And remember, Mike:
3507	3510	- "With the rich and mighty"... - "Always a little patience"?
3565	3567	Do you know what time it is?
3567	3569	It's after 4:00.
3569	3572	In China it's later than that.
3572	3575	In China we'd be married by now.
3577	3579	Or perhaps it's only yesterday.
3579	3581	I'm going home after this dance.
3581	3583	There was a Chinese poet who was drowned...
3583	3586	while trying to kiss the moon in the river.
3586	3589	- He was drunk. - I'd say as much.
3589	3591	But he wrote beautiful poetry.
3606	3610	Macaulay Connor of South Bend reporting for duty.
3610	3612	I'm sorry, we're going home after this dance.
3612	3615	You can't do that to me, not a friend of old Junius.
3615	3619	- I mean, not an old friend of Junius. - I wish old Junius were here.
3619	3621	Tracy, I'll get your wraps.
3621	3622	He'll wrap me up.
3623	3624	- Hello, you. - Hello.
3624	3626	- You look fine. - I feel fine.
3626	3628	Good, good.
3630	3632	Oh, wait a minute. What was I saying?
3633	3636	Oh. Let's have another drink, or would Kittredge spank?
3636	3639	- That's not what you were saying. - It isn't? All right.
3639	3641	Not what I was saying.
3641	3643	Oh, oh, I know.
3643	3647	Why do you wish your brother was here? Does he like Kittredge?
3647	3650	- Everybody likes Kittredge. - Everybody likes Kittredge.
3650	3654	Everybody except C.K. Dexter Haven, huh?
3656	3659	- Come on. We'll have some wine. - Some wine.
3662	3665	Mother, I thought you'd gone home ages ago.
3665	3668	I should have, but I've been having such a good time.
3668	3672	- Everybody should have a good time. - Darling, what's come over you?
3672	3674	Oh, it's just that a lot of things...
3674	3677	I always thought were terribly important...
3677	3682	I find now are... and the other way around and...
3682	3684	Oh, what the dickens.
3684	3687	Connor, you're thirsty, and the night is young.
3688	3691	- Here we are, dear. - We're going to have one more drink...
3691	3694	- Not you, I'm afraid. - Why should you be afraid?
3694	3697	- You know wine never affects me. - Look here...
3697	3700	What she really wants, George, is another dance with you.
3701	3704	- Oh, very well. - Lf it's that much of a chore...
3704	3706	- Not for me! - You've already been too attentive!
3706	3708	George, please.
3708	3710	What will the neighbors think?
3714	3717	- The course of true love. - Gathers no moss.
3726	3728	Boy, champagne.
3730	3733	Just the bottle. I'm going on a picnic.
3736	3740	- You're leaving us, Jock? - Rather, but I'll be back.
3740	3742	Come on, darling, champagne!
3742	3744	And again and again and again!
3752	3753	Follow that cab!
3753	3756	- What cab, sir? - No cab.
3756	3760	Some joke, huh? Take me to the C.K. Dexter Haven mansion.
3760	3762	- Mr. Haven? - Front entrance.
3769	3770	C.K. Dexter Haven!
3775	3777	This is where Cinderella gets off.
3777	3782	You hurry back to the ball before you turn into a pumpkin and six white mice.
3782	3784	Good-bye. C.K. Dexter Haven.
3788	3790	- What's up? - You are.
3791	3792	I hope it's worth it. Come on in.
3793	3795	I bring you greetings.
3795	3798	Cinderella's slipper. It's called champagne.
3798	3801	Champagne is a great "levelerer." Leveler.
3801	3805	- It makes you my equal. - I wouldn't quite say that.
3805	3807	Well, almost my equal.
3807	3810	C.K. Dexter Haven, I would like to talk to you.
3810	3813	Let's go in the talking room.
3816	3820	- Don't tell me the party's over so soon. - No, no.
3820	3823	- I just felt like talking to you. - Well, that's nice.
3833	3835	I wonder if I might borrow a drink.
3835	3837	Certainly. Coals to Newcastle.
3838	3840	Here, sit down.
3851	3852	Excuse me.
3865	3866	What's this?
3868	3869	- Is it my book? - Yes.
3870	3872	C.K. Dexter Haven, you have unsuspected depth.
3873	3876	- Thanks, old chap. - But have you read it?
3876	3878	I was trying to stop drinking. I read anything.
3878	3882	- And did you stop drinking? - Yes. Your book didn't do it, though.
3886	3888	Are you still in love with her?
3888	3891	Or perhaps you'd consider that a very personal question.
3891	3894	- Not at all. - Liz thinks you are!
3894	3896	Liz thinks you are.
3896	3899	But of course, women like to romanti... romanticize about things.
3900	3903	- Yes, they do, don't they? - Yes, they do, don't they?
3903	3906	I can't understand how you could've been married to her...
3906	3908	and still know so little about her.
3908	3910	- Can't you? - No, I can't you.
3912	3916	I have the hiccups. I wonder if I might have another drink?
3916	3918	- Certainly. - Thank you.
3925	3927	You know, Tracy's no ordinary woman...
3927	3930	and you said some things to her this afternoon I resented.
3930	3933	- I apologize, Mr. Connor. - That's quite all right.
3933	3937	But when a girl is like Tracy, she's one in a million. She's...
3938	3940	She's sort of like a... She's sort of like a...
3940	3942	- A goddess? - No, no, no!
3942	3946	You said that word this afternoon. No.
3948	3950	She's sort of like a queen...
3952	3955	a radiant, glorious queen...
3956	3959	and you can't treat her like other women.
3959	3963	No, I suppose not. But then, I imagine Kittredge appreciates all that.
3963	3966	Kittredge! Kittredge appreciates Kittredge!
3966	3970	Ah, that fake "man of the people." He isn't even smart.
3970	3973	He's a five-cent edition of Sidney Kidd.
3974	3977	Well, I always thought Kidd himself was the five-cent kid.
3978	3981	And what's that make you worth, C.K. Dexter Haven...
3981	3983	bringing us down here?
3983	3987	But you know why I did that. To get even with my ex-bride.
3987	3990	Doggone it, C.K. Dexter Haven...
3990	3993	either I'm gonna sock you or you're gonna sock me!
3993	3995	Shall we toss a coin?
3997	4000	Kidd's just using you like he uses everybody else.
4002	4005	You don't know Kidd like I know him.
4005	4010	The guy's colossal. He's terrific. He's got everybody fooled.
4010	4012	Yes.
4013	4017	"No mean Machiavelli is smiling, cynical Sidney Kidd.
4017	4020	"The world's his oyster with an 'R' in every month."
4021	4023	That's not bad. When did I say that?
4023	4025	You didn't. I did. Sorry.
4025	4028	I suppose you never heard about Kidd's arrangement in Kansas City?
4028	4029	- No. - In San Francisco?
4030	4032	Let me tell you about the time he went to Boston...
4032	4035	to be awarded the Sarah Langley Medal for World Peace.
4035	4039	The true story on that little jaunt would ruin him.
4043	4046	Look, Connor. What would happen to you if I used this stuff?
4046	4049	- Why? - I might want to, very much.
4049	4052	Kidd is holding a dirty piece on Tracy's father.
4052	4055	- This might stop him. - On Tracy's father?
4055	4057	That's right.
4059	4061	Oh, so that's how Kidd got you to...
4061	4064	That's how Liz and I were gotten in. Blackmail, huh?
4064	4067	We all rode into this thing on a filthy blackmail.
4067	4070	Look, you use it. Use it with my blessings.
4070	4074	I'm through anyway. I'm not gonna hand in a story on this wedding.
4074	4077	- I'm gonna write one on Kidd. - No, let me do it.
4077	4079	I don't have to tell him where I got my facts. Okay?
4080	4082	- Okay. - All right, come on.
4085	4087	Now shoot.
4087	4089	Peace medal. Boston.
4089	4092	Oh, oh. The time: May, 1938.
4092	4095	The place: Boston, in a hotel.
4095	4097	Kidd had just arrived.
4097	4101	And this same Sidney Kidd, ladies and gentlemen of America...
4101	4104	this protector of American democracy and homes and firesides...
4104	4107	was at that very moment entertaining...
4107	4110	the South Carolina Mata Hari on his yacht.
4110	4112	Don't interrupt me!
4112	4115	This Sidney Kidd, ladies and gentlemen...
4115	4117	who demanded the respect...
4118	4120	of all who were connected with him...
4120	4123	- We've come for the body of Macaulay. - I'm glad you came.
4123	4126	- Can you use a typewriter? - No, thanks. I have one at home.
4128	4129	Who's that?
4129	4133	Here was Sidney Kidd, ladies and gentlemen...
4133	4135	Sidney Kidd the good, Sidney Kidd the noble...
4135	4137	Where's Kittredge?
4137	4139	- The people's choice? - Yeah.
4139	4142	His bride just dropped him at the gatehouse after a slight explosion.
4142	4144	A fight?
4144	4146	Fifteen rounds, no decision.
4146	4149	Where's my wandering parakeet?
4167	4169	You look beautiful, Red.
4174	4175	Come on in.
4177	4179	Why?
4179	4182	No particular reason. A drink, maybe?
4184	4186	I don't drink.
4186	4188	That's right. I forgot.
4191	4192	I haven't.
4197	4200	Show Liz to a typewriter and stand back.
4200	4202	- Can she do it? - She can and she will.
4202	4205	- Dictate to her and then bring her home. - Aren't you coming, Liz?
4205	4208	It seems I've got to commit suicide first.
4208	4210	- Going my way, Miss? - Miss Goddess to you.
4210	4212	Okay, Miss Goddess to me.
4249	4253	Champagne's funny stuff. I'm used to whiskey.
4253	4256	Whiskey's a slap on the back, and champagne's...
4256	4259	heavy mist before my eyes.
4261	4263	Do you hear a telephone ringing?
4264	4266	I did a little while ago. Let's see.
4269	4270	No, not yet.
4273	4275	Now I do, far away.
4279	4281	It's my bedroom telephone.
4283	4286	It couldn't be anyone but George.
4286	4288	I was sort of swinish to him.
4288	4291	Perhaps I'd better go and see what...
4298	4300	It isn't ringing anymore.
4302	4304	I tell you what.
4304	4306	Let's have a quick swim to brighten us up.
4306	4308	Dexter and I always swam after parties.
4308	4311	Let's dip into this instead, huh?
4315	4318	- Hello, you. - Hello.
4318	4320	- You look fine. - I feel fine.
4321	4323	Did you enjoy the party?
4323	4326	Sure. Sure.
4326	4329	The prettiest sight in this fine, pretty world...
4329	4333	is the privileged class enjoying its privileges.
4333	4336	- You're a snob, Connor. - No doubt. No doubt.
4336	4338	"Awash with champagne...
4338	4341	"was Will Q. Tracy's pleasure dome...
4341	4345	"on the nuptial eve of Tracy Samantha... Tracy..."
4350	4353	You can't marry that guy.
4354	4357	George? I'm going to.
4357	4359	- Why not? - I don't know.
4359	4362	I thought I'd be for it at first, but you don't seem to match up.
4362	4364	Then the fault's with me.
4364	4366	Maybe so. But all the same, you can't do it.
4368	4370	Come around about noon tomorrow.
4370	4372	I mean today.
4374	4377	- Snob. - What do you mean, "snob"?
4377	4382	You're the worst kind there is, an intellectual snob.
4382	4385	You made up your mind awfully young, it seems to me.
4385	4387	Thirty's about time to make up your mind.
4387	4389	And I'm nothing of the sort. Not Mr. Connor.
4389	4393	The time to make up your mind about people...
4393	4395	is never.
4396	4399	Yes, you are, and a complete one.
4399	4401	- You're quite a girl, aren't you? - You think?
4402	4405	- Yeah, I know. - I don't think I'm exceptional.
4405	4408	- You are, though. - I know any number like me.
4408	4410	You oughta get around more.
4413	4415	What, in the upper class?
4415	4417	No, no. No, thank you.
4418	4422	You're just a mass of prejudices, aren't you?
4422	4425	You're so much thought and so little feeling, Professor.
4425	4429	- I am, am I? - Yes, you am, are you.
4429	4432	Your intolerance infuriates me!
4433	4436	I should think that, of all people, a writer would need tolerance.
4436	4439	That fact is you'll never, you can't be...
4439	4441	a first-rate writer or a first-rate human being...
4441	4445	until you've learned to have some small regard for human fra...
4450	4454	Aren't the geraniums pretty, Professor?
4456	4459	Is it not a handsome day...
4459	4462	that begins, Professor?
4462	4464	- Lay off that "Professor." - Yes, Professor.
4465	4467	You've got all the arrogance of your class, all right.
4467	4470	How... what have classes to do with it?
4470	4472	What do they matter except for the people in them?
4472	4477	George comes from the so-called lower class; Dexter from the upper. Well?
4477	4481	Mac, the night watchman, is a prince among men; Uncle Willie is a pincher.
4482	4485	Upper and lower, my eye. I'll take the lower, thanks.
4486	4487	If you can't get a drawing room.
4487	4489	- What do you mean by that? - My mistake.
4489	4491	- You're insulting! - I'm sorry.
4491	4495	- Oh, don't apologize! - Who's apologizing?
4496	4498	I never knew such a man.
4498	4500	You wouldn't be likely to, not from where you sit.
4500	4502	Talk about arrogance.
4503	4506	- Tracy. - What do you want?
4507	4509	You're wonderful.
4512	4515	There's a magnificence in you, Tracy.
4518	4521	Now I'm getting self-conscious.
4521	4523	It's funny, l...
4528	4529	Yeah?
4531	4535	I don't know. Go up, I guess. It's late.
4536	4540	A magnificence that comes out of your eyes and your voice...
4540	4543	in the way you stand there, in the way you walk.
4543	4545	You're lit from within, Tracy.
4545	4548	You've got fires banked down in you...
4548	4552	hearth fires and holocausts!
4556	4558	I don't seem to you made of bronze?
4560	4563	No. You're made out of flesh and blood.
4563	4566	That's the blank, unholy surprise of it.
4567	4570	You're the golden girl, Tracy...
4570	4574	full of life and warmth and delight.
4576	4579	What goes on? You got tears in your eyes.
4580	4581	Shut up. Shut up.
4581	4584	Oh, Mike, keep talking. Keep talking.
4584	4586	Talk, will you?
4589	4591	No, no, I've...
4591	4593	I've stopped.
4595	4596	Why?
4597	4601	Has your mind taken hold again, dear Professor?
4602	4606	Well, it's a good thing, don't you agree?
4606	4607	No, Professor.
4607	4609	Lay off that "Professor" stuff! Do you hear me?
4609	4611	Yes, Professor.
4614	4616	- That's all I am to you? - Of course, Professor.
4616	4619	- Are you sure? - Why, yes, of course...
4623	4624	Golly.
4631	4632	- Golly Moses! - Tracy.
4632	4634	- Mr. Connor... - Let me tell you something.
4634	4637	- I've got the shakes. - It can't be anything like love, can it?
4637	4640	No, no, it mustn't be. It can't.
4640	4643	- Would it be inconvenient? - Terribly.
4643	4645	Anyway, I know it isn't.
4645	4647	- Mike, we're out of our minds. - Right into our hearts.
4647	4650	- That ought to have music. - It does, doesn't it?
4650	4653	It's as if my insteps were melting away.
4653	4656	- Have I got feet of clay? - Tracy.
4656	4659	It's not far to the pool. It's in the birch grove.
4659	4661	- It'll be lovely now. - Tracy, you're tremendous.
4661	4663	Put me in your pocket, Mike.
4678	4681	I can't imagine what makes me so sleepy.
4681	4684	- It couldn't be the company. - It's you, Mr. Dexter.
4684	4687	- Hello, Mac. - I heard you were about.
4687	4690	- Any prowlers around? - No prowlers.
4690	4693	- Can Miss lmbrie get in this way? - Lf she can't, you can go in the back.
4693	4695	Good.
4698	4700	- Thanks, Mac. Good night. - Good night, sir.
4701	4705	Well, home after a hard day's blackmailing.
4706	4709	When are you going to telephone Kidd?
4709	4711	In time to get him here for the wedding.
4711	4713	Why?
4714	4717	A sort of wedding present, if it works.
4718	4720	If it works.
4721	4723	I could still tear it up.
4723	4728	No. Mike's only chance to ever become a really fine writer is to get fired.
4729	4731	You're a good number, Liz.
4731	4734	Oh, I just photograph well.
4735	4738	I'm certainly out of focus now.
4738	4740	Why don't you take a swim?
4740	4742	- A swim? - Sure.
4742	4745	Tracy and I always took a swim after a party.
4745	4747	- Did you? - Mm-hmm.
4747	4749	Bet it was fun.
4750	4753	I'll have to try it with Mike sometime.
4754	4757	Liz, why don't you marry him?
4758	4760	- You really want to know? - Mm-hmm.
4761	4763	He's still got a lot to learn.
4763	4766	I don't want to get in his way for a while.
4770	4772	It's risky though, Liz.
4772	4775	Suppose another girl came along in the meantime?
4775	4777	I'd scratch her eyes out, I guess.
4778	4781	That is, unless she was going to marry somebody else the next day.
4804	4806	- Hello, Kittredge. - What are you doing here?
4806	4808	I'm a friend of the family's. Dropped in for a chat.
4808	4811	Don't try to be funny. I asked you a question.
4811	4814	I could ask you the same question.
4814	4816	I telephoned Tracy, and her phone didn't answer.
4816	4818	I was worried, so I walked over.
4818	4821	- I was worried too. - About what?
4821	4825	What do you think of this fellow Connor, or do you?
4825	4826	If you're trying to insinuate...
4827	4830	My dear chap, I wouldn't insinuate anything, only...
4837	4839	Kittredge, I'd advise you to go to bed.
4839	4841	I don't want your advice. I'm staying right here.
4841	4845	You're making a mistake. Somehow I don't think you'll understand.
4845	4849	- Maybe you'd better leave that to... - Dreams really do come true
4850	4852	Someday I'll wish upon a star
4852	4855	- What's that? - It's Mac, the night watchman.
4855	4857	Always singing. I'll walk you around the house.
4857	4860	Something's going on here, and I'm staying.
4860	4862	And so are you.
4862	4865	All right, then. Take the works.
4865	4867	Only heaven help you.
4867	4872	Somewhere over the rainbow
4872	4874	Way up high
4874	4877	There's a land that I heard of
4877	4880	Once in a lullaby
4886	4889	And the dreams
4889	4892	That I dare to dre...
4892	4895	- Uh-oh. - Don't stop, Mikey.
4895	4896	Keep crooning.
4899	4904	Someday over the rainbow
4904	4906	Way up high
4906	4909	- What is this, Connor? - Easy, old man. She's not hurt?
4909	4913	- No, no. - Not wounded, sire, but dead.
4913	4917	Seems the minute she hit the water, the wine hit her.
4917	4919	- Look here, Connor. - A likely story!
4920	4922	- What'd you say? - A likely story!
4922	4924	- Lf you think that... - You'll be down directly?
4924	4926	- Yes, if you want! - I want.
4927	4929	Hello, Dexter.
4929	4931	Hello, George.
4932	4933	Hello, Mike.
4942	4944	Second door to the right, top of the stairs. Don't wake Dinah.
4944	4947	My feet are made of clay. Did you know?
4947	4949	Good night, little man.
4953	4955	How are the mighty fallen.
4959	4961	If I know Tracy, and I know her well...
4961	4963	she'll remember little of this.
4963	4966	For the second time in her life, she'll draw quite a tidy blank.
4970	4973	- You don't believe it, then? - Believe what?
4973	4976	Well, the implications of what you saw, let us say.
4977	4980	- What else am I to believe? - That's entirely up to you.
4980	4983	I got eyes, I got imagination, haven't I?
4983	4985	I don't know. Have you?
4985	4988	Oh, so you pretend not to believe it.
4988	4990	Yes, I pretend not to.
4990	4992	- Then you don't know women. - That's possible.
4992	4995	- And you're a fool. - That's quite possible.
4996	4999	- You won't be too hard on her? - I'll make up my own mind what I'll be!
4999	5001	We're all only human, you know.
5001	5004	You! All of you with your sophisticated ideas!
5005	5006	Ain't it awful?
5013	5015	Why, you low...
5017	5019	What right have you...
5019	5022	A husband's. 'Til tomorrow, Kittredge.
5025	5027	Hey, fella.
5028	5031	How do you feel?
5031	5033	- Lf you think l... - I know.
5033	5036	I'm sorry. I thought I'd better hit you before he did.
5036	5039	He's in better shape than I am.
5039	5041	Well, you'll do.
5043	5046	Hello, Mr. Dexter. Anything wrong?
5046	5048	Not a thing, Mac. Just as quiet as a church.
5049	5050	Who is it?
5054	5057	Doggone. I thought it might've been Mr. Kittredge.
5057	5059	We can't have everything, Mac.
5060	5062	Good night.
5086	5088	- Mr. Tracy... - Good grief, man.
5089	5091	Don't scream at me at the top of your voice like that.
5091	5093	Miss Dinah is waiting for you, sir.
5093	5096	Miss Dinah waiting for me? Where and why?
5096	5098	Just outside the door, sir. I don't know why.
5098	5102	This is one of those days which the pages of history teach us...
5102	5104	are best spent lying in bed.
5111	5113	Uncle Willie!
5114	5116	Uncle Willie, where are you going?
5116	5118	Back to bed, unless you give me your oath...
5118	5120	you will speak in a civilized tone of voice.
5120	5123	I'll be quiet, Uncle Willie. It's so important that I see you.
5124	5127	Must we ride in that thing? Wouldn't we be more comfortable on pogo sticks?
5127	5130	I had to be alone with you, and this is very intimate.
5143	5145	- What's the matter? - Oh, nothing much.
5145	5147	My head just fell off, that's all.
5149	5152	What is all this gibberish about Mr. Connor?
5152	5155	What makes you suspect what and since when?
5156	5159	Last night, and well into the morning.
5159	5161	Uncle Willie, isn't my duty to tell George?
5162	5163	He might want to marry her anyway.
5163	5167	But she can't. If she marries anyone, it's got to be Mr. Connor.
5167	5171	Why, Dinah. What makes you think she should?
5171	5174	Apparently the little cherub has heard or seen something.
5175	5177	That's Dexter's own Dinah.
5177	5180	You have a certain amount of cheek walking in here on this of all mornings.
5180	5183	- Do I? - Yes.
5183	5185	What's all this about Mr. Connor, Dinah?
5185	5187	Did the party last night give you bad dreams?
5187	5190	- It wasn't any dream. - I wouldn't be too sure.
5190	5192	It's hard to tell once you've gone to sleep, isn't it?
5192	5194	Is it?
5195	5198	What-ho, the bride.
5204	5206	Hello.
5207	5210	Um, isn't it a fine day, though.
5213	5215	Is everybody fine?
5216	5217	That's fine.
5219	5221	My, I'm hearty.
5223	5225	How do you feel otherwise?
5225	5227	I don't know what's the matter with me.
5227	5229	I must have had too much sun yesterday.
5229	5232	- My eyes don't open properly. - Really?
5232	5236	Ugh! Please go home, Dext.
5236	5238	Not until we've got those eyes open.
5238	5240	Uncle Willie. Good morning.
5240	5242	That remains to be seen.
5243	5245	Aren't you here early, Uncle Willie?
5245	5248	It's nearly half past twelve.
5248	5250	It can't be. Where's Mother?
5250	5253	She's talking with the orchestra. Father with the minister.
5253	5257	And Mr. Connor, he hasn't come down yet.
5258	5260	And it's Saturday, your wedding day, remember?
5260	5263	Thanks loads. It's nice to have things account...
5263	5265	Only I wonder what this might be.
5265	5267	- That looks like a wristwatch. - But whose?
5267	5269	I found it in my room. I nearly stepped on it.
5274	5278	Also, I think I was robbed at your house last night, Uncle Willie.
5278	5281	My bracelet and engagement rings are missing...
5281	5284	- Here you are. - But you weren't at the party.
5284	5285	- Wasn't I? - Were you?
5286	5288	Don't tell me you don't remember.
5288	5292	I do, now, sort of.
5292	5295	But there were such a lot of people. I stayed so late.
5295	5297	You should have taken a quick swim when you got home.
5297	5299	A swim?
5299	5301	A swim!
5301	5303	There! Now they're open.
5303	5307	That was just the beginning, and it was no dream.
5309	5311	Do you suppose, speaking of eye-openers...
5311	5314	That's the first sane remark I've heard today. Come along.
5314	5318	I know a formula that can pop pennies off the eyelids of dead Irishmen.
5319	5321	Dinah, if the conversation should lag...
5321	5324	you might tell Tracy about your dream.
5324	5327	- What did he say? - Oh, nothing.
5327	5327	- What did he say? - Oh, nothing.
5327	5330	Tray, I hate you to get married and go away.
5330	5333	I'll miss you, darling. I'll miss all of you.
5333	5337	You know, I did have the funniest dream about you last night.
5337	5339	Did you? Do you like my dress, Dinah?
5340	5342	- Yes, ever so much. - Feels awfully heavy.
5343	5345	It was all certainly pretty rooty-tooty.
5345	5348	- What was? - My dream.
5348	5351	I dreamed I got up and went over to the window.
5351	5354	Guess what I dreamed I saw coming over out of the woods.
5354	5357	I haven't the faintest idea. A skunk?
5357	5361	Well, sort of. It was Mr. Connor.
5361	5362	Mr. Connor?
5362	5367	Yes, with his arms full of something, and guess what it turned out to be.
5367	5371	- What? - You, and some clothes.
5371	5375	Wasn't it funny? It was sort of like as if you were coming from the pool.
5377	5379	The pool?
5379	5382	I'm going crazy. I'm standing here, solidly, on my own two hands...
5382	5384	and going crazy.
5384	5389	- Then what? - After a while, I opened my door...
5389	5391	and there he was in the hall, still coming along with you...
5391	5394	puffing like a steam engine.
5394	5396	His wind can't be very good.
5396	5397	Then what?
5397	5400	- You were sort of crooning. - I never crooned in my life.
5400	5403	I'm only saying what it sounded like.
5403	5405	And then he...
5406	5408	Guess what.
5408	5409	I couldn't possibly.
5409	5412	He sailed right into your room with you, and that scared me...
5412	5414	so I got up and went to your door...
5414	5418	and peeked in to make sure you were all right.
5418	5420	And guess what.
5421	5423	- What? - You were. He was gone by then.
5424	5427	Gone?
5427	5430	Of course he was gone. He was never there.
5430	5431	I know, Tracy.
5431	5435	- I should certainly hope you did. - I'm certainly glad I do.
5435	5439	Because if I didn't, and in a little while I heard the minister say...
5439	5443	"If anyone knows any just cause or reason why these two...
5443	5446	"should not be united in holy matrimony..."
5446	5448	I just wouldn't know what to do.
5448	5452	- Dexter says it's a dream too. - You told Dexter all that?
5452	5455	Not a word. Not a single word.
5455	5457	You know how quick he is.
5457	5459	You little fiend. How can you stand there...
5459	5461	Dinah, your mother wants to have a look at you.
5461	5464	I look wonderful. I smell good too.
5464	5466	- Father? - Yes, Tracy.
5469	5471	I'm glad you came back.
5473	5474	I'm glad you're here.
5474	5476	Thank you, child.
5477	5483	I'm sorry I'm... truly sorry I'm a disappointment to you.
5483	5485	I never said that, daughter.
5486	5488	I never will.
5495	5497	- Good morning. - Oh. Hello.
5501	5502	I'm testing the air.
5502	5504	I like it, but it doesn't like me.
5505	5506	Hello, Dinah.
5506	5509	How do you do?
5509	5511	Did you have a good sleep?
5511	5513	Wonderful. Wonderful. And you?
5513	5516	Marvelous. Have you ever seen a handsomer day?
5516	5518	Never, never. What'd it set you back?
5518	5520	I got it for nothing for being a good girl.
5521	5522	Good. Good.
5524	5526	Don't worry, I'm going.
5526	5528	Why should you?
5528	5531	I guess you must have things you wish to discuss.
5531	5534	Only remember, it's getting late.
5537	5541	She's always trying to make situations.
5551	5554	- What's the matter with your chin? - Chin?
5554	5557	Oh. Does it show that much?
5557	5558	A little. What happened?
5558	5561	I guess I stuck it out too far.
5561	5563	Into a door in the dark?
5563	5567	Yes, that's it. What about you? You all right?
5567	5568	- Me? - Yeah.
5568	5571	Of course. Why shouldn't I be?
5571	5573	That was a flock of wine we got away with.
5573	5576	I guess we're lucky both to have such good heads.
5576	5579	Yeah, yeah, I guess that's it.
5581	5584	Well, anyway, I...
5584	5587	I had a simply wonderful evening. I hope you enjoyed it too.
5587	5589	I enjoyed the last part of it.
5590	5592	Really?
5592	5595	Why especially the last?
5595	5597	Tracy, are you asking me?
5598	5600	- Oh, you mean the swim. - Yeah.
5601	5603	We did swim...
5605	5607	and so forth, didn't we?
5608	5610	- Mike. - Oh, Tracy, darling.
5610	5613	- What can I say to you? - Not anything.
5613	5615	Don't say anything and especially not "darling."
5618	5620	- You're going through with it? - Through with what?
5620	5622	The wedding.
5622	5624	Why shouldn't I?
5625	5628	Well, I made a funny discovery.
5628	5631	In spite of the fact that somebody's up from the bottom...
5631	5633	he can still be quite a heel...
5633	5637	and even though somebody else is born to the purple, he...
5637	5639	he can still be a very nice guy.
5639	5643	I'm just repeating what you said last night.
5643	5646	I said a lot of things last night, it seems.
5647	5649	Okay. No dice.
5650	5652	Also no regrets about last night, huh?
5652	5654	Why should I have?
5654	5656	Tracy, you're wonderful.
5656	5661	I'm asking you. Tell me straight out. Tell me the reason why I should have.
5661	5663	No, don't.
5663	5665	Just tell me, what time is it?
5666	5668	What? Oh.
5669	5671	What happened to my wristwatch?
5672	5673	Why, is it broken?
5674	5676	I must've lost it someplace.
5676	5679	I can't tell you how extremely sorry I am to hear that.
5681	5683	There. On the table.
5683	5687	I wonder who found it. I'd offer a reward or something.
5687	5690	I don't think that any reward will be expected.
5691	5694	Funny that it'd pop up here.
5694	5698	Hey, what about an eye-opener?
5698	5702	My eyes are opened. Go and get one if you want to, though.
5702	5704	Yeah, I think I will. Excuse me.
5705	5707	Yes, yes.
5708	5710	Just give Mr. Kittredge a message.
5710	5713	Tell him he'd better start immediately. Thank you.
5714	5717	- Are you one of the musicians? - Uh, no.
5717	5719	Of course, you're Junius's friend.
5719	5722	Only you're not. You don't have any violin strings, do you?
5725	5727	- Aspirin. Will that do? - I don't think so.
5727	5730	It's for a violin. Oh, well, don't bother.
5738	5741	- Hello, Connor. How are you? - Just about as you'd think.
5741	5743	You seen Kidd?
5743	5745	I left a copy of it at my house for him.
5745	5747	- And? - I'll tangle with him after the wedding.
5747	5750	- Is that an alcoholic beverage? - Yes. Why?
5750	5752	- For me? - No, for Tracy. You want one?
5752	5756	I'd sell my grandmother for a drink. You know how I love my grandmother.
5756	5759	Uncle Willie's in the pantry doing weird and wonderful things.
5759	5761	Tell him I said one of the same.
5762	5763	Mind if I make it two?
5763	5765	That's between you and your grandmother.
5782	5784	Doctor's orders, Red.
5784	5786	What is it?
5786	5789	Just the juice of a few flowers.
5789	5791	It's a type of stinger. Removes the sting.
5791	5795	- Oh, Dext, don't say that. - Why not, Red?
5795	5798	Nothing will. Nothing ever can.
5801	5804	I've done the most terrible thing to you.
5804	5806	To me?
5806	5809	I doubt that very much, dear.
5809	5811	You don't know.
5811	5812	Maybe I shouldn't, huh?
5812	5816	But you must. You've got to. I couldn't stand it if you didn't.
5816	5818	Dexter, what am I going to do?
5818	5821	But why to me, darling? Why ask me?
5823	5825	Why do I come into it anymore?
5825	5829	Aren't you confusing me with a fellow named Kittredge or something?
5829	5830	George!
5831	5835	George. Splendid chap, George. Very high morals.
5835	5836	Very broad shoulders.
5836	5838	I've got to tell him.
5838	5841	- Tell him what, darling? - I've got to tell him.
5843	5845	If you've got to tell him, you've got to tell him.
5845	5848	If he's got any brains, he'll have realized what a fool he made of himself.
5848	5851	Hello, George? This is... yeah.
5851	5853	I don't care whether it's bad luck or not...
5854	5856	but I've got to see you before the wedding.
5856	5859	What? No, I didn't get it.
5859	5861	Right. Come on the run.
5861	5863	- He sent a note over at ten. - Good.
5863	5865	I told you he'd come to his senses.
5866	5869	- Was he here too? - Sure.
5869	5871	Good golly. Why didn't you sell tickets?
5885	5886	Say something, Dext.
5888	5889	Say anything.
5892	5895	- No, you do. - Oh, Dext!
5895	5897	I'm such an unholy mess of a girl.
5899	5901	That's no good. That's not even conversation.
5903	5906	But never in my life...
5906	5908	not if I live to be a hundred...
5908	5912	will I ever forget how you tried to stand me on my feet again today.
5912	5914	Oh, you, you're in great shape.
5917	5920	Tell me, what did you think of my wedding present?
5920	5922	I like my presents at least acknowledged, you know.
5922	5924	It was beautiful.
5925	5927	And sweet, Dext.
5927	5933	Yes. She was quite a boat, the True Love, wasn't she?
5933	5935	Was and is.
5937	5939	My, she was yare!
5940	5942	She was yare, all right.
5944	5947	I wasn't, was I?
5949	5950	Not very.
5951	5953	You were good at the bright work, though.
5953	5955	I made her shine.
5956	5958	Where is she now?
5958	5960	I'm gonna sell her to Rufe Watriss.
5961	5965	You're going to sell the True Love for money?
5965	5968	- Sure. - To that fat old rum pot?
5968	5970	Oh, well, what does it matter?
5970	5972	When you're through with a boat, you're through.
5973	5976	Besides, it was only comfortable for two people.
5977	5979	Unless you want her.
5980	5983	No. No, I don't want her.
5986	5988	I'm designing another one anyway...
5988	5990	along more practical lines.
5991	5993	What will you call her?
5993	5996	I thought the True Love II. What do you think?
5996	6000	If you call any boat that, I promise I'll blow you and it out of the water.
6000	6003	I'll tell you what you can call her.
6003	6006	- What? - In fond remembrance of me...
6006	6008	the Easy Virtue.
6009	6012	Shut up, Red. I can't have you thinking things like that about yourself.
6012	6016	What am I supposed to think when l... I don't know.
6016	6018	I don't know anything anymore.
6019	6022	That sounds very hopeful, Red.
6022	6023	That sounds just fine.
6026	6029	We're almost ready. Stand up, dear.
6029	6032	Turn around. Oh, yes, it's lovely.
6032	6035	I'm glad we decided against... Dexter, you shouldn't be here...
6035	6037	against the blue one.
6037	6039	No games, Dexter. George will be right over.
6039	6042	I just telephoned. Here's a note he sent you this morning.
6042	6046	Oh, dear, doesn't everything look lovely?
6046	6047	Dr. Parsons?
6049	6051	Mr. Kittredge hasn't arrived yet, Dr. Parsons.
6051	6054	Come along. I want you to meet Tracy's grandmother.
6054	6057	Tracy, don't sit down again until after the ceremony.
6057	6060	Dexter, they telephoned from your house that a Mr. Sidney Kidd was there.
6060	6064	I was to tell you that he's reading it. Whatever does that mean?
6066	6069	I have a feeling it won't be so hard for me to resign now.
6069	6072	And belts will be worn tighter this winter.
6073	6076	Well, Red, I'm afraid it's the deadline.
6077	6079	So is this. Listen.
6079	6082	"My dear Tracy, I want you to know that you will always be my friend...
6082	6086	"but your conduct last night was so shocking to my ideals of womanhood..."
6086	6089	No, don't go. You might as well hear it too.
6089	6091	"To my ideals of womanhood that my attitude toward you...
6091	6093	"and the prospect of a happy and useful life together...
6093	6095	"has been changed materially.
6096	6098	- "Your breach of common decency..." - Tracy.
6100	6102	Hello, George.
6102	6104	Tracy, all these people.
6107	6109	It's only a letter from a friend.
6109	6111	They're my friends too.
6112	6115	"...certainly entitles me to a full explanation...
6115	6118	"before going through with our proposed marriage.
6118	6121	"In the light of day, I am sure that you will agree with me.
6121	6124	"Otherwise, with profound regrets and all best wishes...
6124	6126	"yours very sincere..."
6127	6130	Yes, George, I quite agree with you.
6130	6133	In the light of day and the dark of night...
6133	6137	for richer, for poorer, for better, for worse...
6137	6139	in sickness and in health and...
6140	6144	Thank you so very much for your good wishes at this time.
6144	6148	- That's all you have to say? - What else?
6148	6150	I wish, for your sake as well as mine...
6151	6153	I had an explanation, but...
6153	6156	unfortunately, I have none.
6156	6158	You'd better just say good riddance, George.
6158	6160	- It isn't easy. - I don't see why.
6162	6164	- Say something, stupid! - Just wait a minute.
6164	6165	What for?
6165	6168	On the very eve of your wedding, an affair with another man!
6168	6172	I told you I agree, and I'll tell you again, good riddance to me.
6172	6175	Tracy, your attitude is a little difficult to understand.
6175	6177	- Yes, I can see that it would be. - Not necessarily.
6177	6181	- You keep out of this. - You forget, I am out of it.
6181	6184	Kittredge, it may interest you to know...
6184	6187	that this so-called "affair" consisted of exactly two kisses...
6187	6189	and a late swim.
6189	6190	- Thanks, but... - Which I enjoyed...
6191	6193	and the memory of which I wouldn't part with for anything.
6193	6195	- It's no use, Mike. - After which...
6196	6199	I deposited Tracy on her bed in her room...
6199	6202	and returned down here to you two, which doubtless you'll remember.
6202	6204	Doubtless without a doubt.
6204	6207	You mean to say that was all there was to it?
6207	6208	I do.
6210	6214	Why? Was I so unattractive, so distant, so forbidding or something?
6215	6217	- This is fine talk too. - I'm asking a question.
6217	6220	You were extremely attractive, and as for distant and forbidding...
6221	6224	on the contrary, but you also were a little the worse...
6224	6227	or better... for wine, and there are rules about that.
6227	6231	Thank you, Mike. I think men are wonderful.
6231	6232	The little dears.
6232	6235	I fail to see the humor in this situation, Miss lmbrie.
6235	6239	I can appreciate that. It was hard for me too at first.
6239	6241	- Oh, Liz. - It's all right, Tracy.
6241	6245	We all go haywire at times, and if we don't, maybe we ought to.
6247	6250	You see, it really wasn't Tracy at all, Mr. Kittredge.
6251	6255	It was another girl. A Miss Pommery, 1926.
6255	6258	You'd had too much to drink, Tracy.
6258	6261	That seems to be the consensus of opinion.
6261	6264	Will you promise me never to touch the stuff again?
6265	6268	No, George. I don't believe I will.
6268	6270	There are certain things about that other girl...
6271	6274	that... Miss Pommery '26, I rather like.
6274	6276	- But a man expects his wife... - To behave herself. Naturally.
6276	6278	To behave herself naturally.
6280	6282	Sorry.
6283	6288	If it hadn't been for that drink last night, all this might not have happened.
6288	6290	Apparently nothing did.
6290	6292	What made you think it had?
6292	6294	Well, it didn't take much imagination.
6294	6298	Not much, perhaps, but just of a certain kind.
6298	6300	It seems you didn't think anything too well of yourself.
6300	6302	That's the odd thing.
6302	6305	Somehow I'd have hoped that you'd think better of me than I did.
6305	6308	I'm not going to quibble. All the evidence was there.
6308	6311	And I was guilty straight off until I was proved innocent.
6311	6313	Downright un-American, if you ask me.
6313	6316	Nobody is asking you.
6316	6318	You forgot your hat, Miss Tracy.
6318	6321	You look lovely, Miss Tracy. All our very best wishes.
6323	6327	Dexter, I wish you'd let me know when you invite people to Tracy's weddings.
6327	6329	- What happened, darling? - A Mr. Sidney Kidd is here.
6329	6331	He says he knows you.
6331	6334	Sidney Kidd is here himself?
6334	6336	What else did Mr. Sidney Kidd have to say?
6336	6340	He sent you the strangest message. He said, "Tell Haven he wins."
6340	6343	"Tell him I'm licked." Wins what, Dexter?
6346	6350	Mr. Sidney Kidd's presence here makes the marriage of national importance.
6350	6353	I think it's extremely kind and thoughtful of him.
6356	6359	Come on, Tracy, it must be late. Let's let bygones be bygones.
6359	6361	What do you say?
6361	6364	Yes, and good-bye, George.
6366	6368	- I don't understand you. - Please, good-bye.
6368	6370	- Look here... - You're too good for me.
6370	6372	- You're a hundred times too good. - But I never said...
6372	6374	I'd make you most unhappy. Most.
6375	6378	That is, I'd do my best to.
6379	6381	Well, if that's the way you want it.
6382	6384	That's the way it is.
6385	6387	All right. Possibly it's just as well.
6388	6390	Yes, I thought you'd finally come to that conclusion.
6392	6395	I have a feeling you had more to do with this than anyone.
6395	6399	- Possibly, but you were a great help. - You and your whole rotten class.
6399	6401	Class, my eye.
6401	6404	You're on your way out, the lot of you, and good riddance!
6406	6408	There goes George.
6416	6419	Oh, my sainted aunt!
6430	6433	- That welter of faces. - Oh, my, they look solemn.
6433	6435	What am I to do?
6435	6436	- Tracy? - Yes, Mike?
6436	6439	Parson Parsons has never seen Kittredge before, has he?
6439	6443	I got you into this thing, and I'll get you out of it.
6443	6445	Will you marry me, Tracy?
6451	6452	No, Mike.
6453	6458	Thanks, but hmm-mm. Nope.
6458	6460	I've never asked a girl to marry me.
6460	6461	I've avoided it.
6461	6464	But you've got me all confused now.
6464	6465	Why not?
6467	6469	Because I don't think Liz would like it...
6470	6473	and I'm not sure you would...
6473	6477	and I'm even a little doubtful about myself.
6478	6480	But I am beholden to you, Mike.
6481	6483	I'm most beholden.
6484	6486	But they're in there. They're waiting.
6486	6490	Don't get too conventional all at once, will ya? There'll be a reaction.
6492	6497	Cheer up. It'll be all right. You've been got out of jams before.
6497	6499	- Been got out of them? - Certainly.
6499	6501	Don't worry. You always have been.
6504	6506	We've seen George. It's all right, dear.
6506	6508	Your father will make a very simple announcement.
6509	6511	Is there anything special you want me to say, Tracy?
6511	6515	Uh, no, no. I'll say it.
6515	6519	Whatever it is, I'll say it. I won't be got out of anything anymore, thanks.
6528	6530	Hello.
6530	6533	Good morning. L... Stop that music.
6535	6537	I'm sorry to have kept you waiting...
6537	6542	but there's been a slight hitch in the proceedings.
6542	6546	I've made a terrible fool of myself, which isn't unusual...
6546	6550	and my fiancé... my fiancé that was, that is...
6550	6555	he thinks we'd better call it a day, and I quite agree with him.
6556	6558	Peace is wonderful.
6558	6561	Uh, bec... uh... Dexter, what next?
6561	6564	Three years ago I did you out of a wedding in this house by eloping.
6564	6569	- Two years ago, you were invited... - My dear, just a loan.
6569	6571	- Put this in your vest pocket. - Don't have a vest.
6571	6573	Then hold it in your hand.
6574	6576	- Which was very bad manners. - Which was very bad manners.
6576	6579	I'll make it up to you by going through with it now as originally planned.
6579	6581	I'll make it up to you by...
6585	6589	by going beautifully through with it now...
6589	6592	as originally and most beautifully planned.
6592	6596	- So if you'll just keep your seats... - So if you'll just keep your seats...
6596	6599	- That's all. - Um, that's all.
6599	6601	- Are you sure? - No, but I'll risk it. Will you?
6601	6605	You bet. You didn't do it to soften the blow? Nor to save my face?
6605	6607	- No, it's a nice face. - I'll be yare now.
6607	6611	- I'll promise to be yare. - Be whatever you like. You all set?
6611	6613	- All set. - Best man?
6613	6614	Honored, C.K.
6615	6617	- Maid of honor? - Matron of honor.
6617	6618	Remember Joe Smith.
6618	6620	How did this ever happen?
6621	6623	You'd better tell Mr. Dutton to start the music.
6624	6627	This can't be happening. It just can't. Come with me, Miss lmbrie.
6627	6629	Let's get in there. Got the ring?
6629	6631	The way we're dressed, we look like stowaways.
6631	6633	See ya soon, Red.
6633	6634	See ya soon, Dext.
6639	6641	- Tracy, darling... - I love you, Father.
6641	6642	I love you too.
6642	6645	Never in my life have I been so full of love before.
6645	6647	Come along. Come along.
6647	6649	Wait. How do I look?
6649	6651	Like a queen. Like a goddess.
6651	6654	- And you know how I feel? - How?
6654	6656	Like a human. Like a human being.
6656	6659	- Do you know how I feel? - How?
6659	6660	Proud.
6693	6697	I did it. I did it all.
6697	6700	I feel as though I've lived through all this before in another life.
