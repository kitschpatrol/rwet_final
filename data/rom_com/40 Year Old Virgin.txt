116	118	Hey, Andy! What's up, dude?
118	120	Hey, Joe. Hey, Sara. How you doing?
120	121	When you going to get a car?
121	125	- Hey, why don't you get a car? - I can't afford it.
127	130	- So, Survivor tomorrow night. We on? - See you then.
130	132	I'll bring a soda. Hey, enjoy your orange.
132	134	- Okay, take care. - See you. Bye-bye.
135	139	- That guy needs to get laid. - Tell me something I don't know.
155	156	Good morning.
162	164	Excuse me. Pardon me.
165	167	Sorry.
176	177	Excuse me. Thank you.
180	182	- Good morning. - Hey.
182	184	- Good morning, Paula. - Andy.
186	188	Excuse me. I have a question.
189	194	What is the difference between Hi8 and Digital video tapes?
194	196	I'm not a salesman, so, I could probably...
197	199	Welcome to Smart Tech. How can I be of service to you?
199	201	Well, I was just wondering...
201	203	what is the difference between these?
204	207	Well, if I'm photographing someone as fine as yourself...
207	209	I'd probably go Digital.
212	216	# Hey, don't worry I've been lied to #
222	225	- My God. Sorry I'm late, man. - No problem.
226	228	Oh, man.
229	231	- I had a weekend. - Yeah?
231	234	We went to Tijuana, Mexico, you know...
234	237	and we thought it would be fun, you know, to go to this show.
237	239	Everyone's, "You gotta check out one of these shows."
240	242	And, you know, it's a woman fucking a horse.
242	246	We get there, and, you know, we think it's gonna be awesome...
246	249	and it is not as cool as it sounds like it would be, man.
249	252	- It's kind of gross. - Yeah.
252	253	You think, "A woman fucking a horse"...
253	255	and you get there and it's...
255	257	- ...a woman fucking a horse. - Yeah.
257	259	It was really giving it to her.
259	260	And you know what...
261	263	to be honest, I felt bad for her. We all just felt bad for her.
263	265	- Yeah. - Kind of felt bad for the horse.
265	268	- Wow, that's something. - So what did you get up to?
269	272	You know, I just kind of hung out. I was...
273	274	God, Friday, when I went home...
274	277	I really wanted an egg-salad sandwich.
277	279	And I was just obsessing about it and I was like:
279	281	"Man, I'm gonna make one of those."
281	284	So Saturday I went out and I got, like, a dozen eggs...
284	287	and I boiled them all and then I just...
287	290	I spent, I don't know, probably three hours...
292	294	like, three-and-a-half hours making...
294	298	you know, the mayonnaise and the onions and paprika...
298	300	and, you know, all the accoutrement.
300	302	And then, by the time I was done...
302	303	I just really didn't feel like eating it.
303	306	- I can imagine. - And I didn't have any bread.
306	310	So, you know, it was pretty good. It was a good weekend.
310	313	- Sounds pretty awesome. - Yeah, it was fine.
313	314	Sounds really fun.
315	317	- Cool. - Cool.
317	318	Cool, cool.
321	323	- Hey, Paula. - Yeah.
323	326	I gotta tell you something. I'm really excited about it.
326	329	For the first time today, I woke up...
329	333	I came to the store, and I feel confident to say to you...
334	336	that if you don't take this Michael McDonald DVD...
336	339	that you've been playing for two years straight, off...
339	340	I'm going to kill everyone in the store...
340	342	and put a bullet in my brain.
343	346	- David, what do you suggest we play? - I don't care. Anything.
346	349	I would rather watch Beautician and the Beast.
349	352	I would rather listen to Fran Drescher for eight hours...
352	354	than have to listen to Michael McDonald.
354	357	Nothing against him, but if I hear Yah Mo B There one more time...
357	360	I'm gonna yah mo burn this place to the ground.
360	362	You're such a smart ass. Get back on the floor.
365	366	Fuck you.
367	370	This is a great TV. Nothing beats a plasma.
370	372	What are you doing? That's my customer.
372	375	It certainly is not. When I came upon her, she was unattended.
375	377	- No, that's my... - Wait.
377	379	Go to the checkout there. Pick up there, please.
379	381	She was unattended because I went to the back...
381	383	to get the brochure that she requested.
383	384	I apologize, but it's too late.
384	386	The transaction has been completed.
386	387	Then you're gonna give me half the commission.
388	389	You'll receive none of the commission.
389	391	I need to talk to Paula. This is crazy.
391	392	This is bullshit.
392	394	Every time I make a sale, you go crying to Paula.
394	397	How about Jesse Jackson? Old Jesse needs a cause.
397	399	Sick of you poaching my customers.
399	400	I'm sick of your crybaby bullshit.
400	403	You wanna take this shit outside? Just take it outside and squash it?
403	407	Let's stay inside, so everybody can see what a pussy you have, okay?
407	410	Because when I remove the blade I keep in my boot from its sheath...
410	413	I can't return it until it has spilled blood.
413	416	Look, listen to me. You are fucking with the wrong nigger.
417	420	Hey! You're fucking with the wrong sun-nigger, okay?
420	423	Dude, I will hang your old ass by your turban.
423	426	Turban now? Do you see any fucking turban here?
426	428	Do I talk like a turban guy?
428	431	Do I say, "Hey, Jay, do you want a Slurpee? You want a Slurpee?"
431	434	Fuck you, okay? I was born in Brooklyn.
434	435	Brooklyn, okay?
435	439	My accent is a fucking Brooklyn accent, okay? Okay?
439	440	All right, man. Calm down, dude.
440	443	Look, you still covering my shift on Friday or what?
443	446	If I can keep this commission, with pleasure.
446	449	- Cool, then. All right, pop. - No problem.
452	453	- How about Andy? - No.
454	455	Come on, man. We need, what, five guys...
455	457	- ...to play a decent poker game, right? - Yeah.
457	458	If we cancel this, I'm gonna have to go...
458	460	to some stupid-ass birthday party with Jill...
460	462	and that shit ain't happening.
462	463	- No. - Why not?
464	467	He's a really nice guy and all but I'm pretty sure that...
467	469	he is a serial murderer.
469	470	Who cares, man? He's a nice guy.
470	473	I just wanna get drunk, fucked up, and play some cards.
473	475	That's great. Look, I don't wanna end up a lampshade...
475	477	in some creepy apartment, that's what I'm saying.
477	479	I don't really see any other options.
479	482	Andy. My man.
483	485	You got any plans later on tonight?
485	487	Why, do we have to unload the Sony truck?
487	490	No, the guys are getting together, we're playing some poker...
490	492	thought, you know, you'd wanna play.
492	494	With you guys?
495	498	Yeah, sure. That would be cool.
498	501	- You know how to play, right? - Yeah, I play online sometimes.
501	504	- We're gonna play in the store. - Great.
504	505	Are we allowed to do that?
505	507	- Absolutely not. - Yeah.
507	508	Oh.
508	510	Well, so I'm gonna go tell Paula.
512	513	I'm just kidding.
513	516	I'm kidding. That sounds great. Cool, I'll see you guys tonight.
516	517	- Okay. - All right.
517	519	Oops.
521	523	- I almost feel guilty. - No, you don't.
537	539	Going down!
540	541	Going down!
541	543	Dumbass.
543	545	And a full house.
545	547	- Oh, my dukes! - What?
547	549	How much fucking online poker do you play, dawg?
549	552	For like an hour or two a night, when I'm not playing Halo.
553	555	Why did you invite this guy? He's a fucking ringer, man.
555	557	This is hog shit.
557	559	You, you're a fucking asshole to tell me to come here.
559	561	You tell me he was a nice guy, didn't you?
561	563	Well, fuck you people, and fuck you, you and you...
563	566	fuck and kiss my big brown fucking ass, okay?
566	568	I'm gonna see you tomorrow.
568	569	- Peace. - All right, man.
569	570	Fuck a goat.
571	573	- Good night. - I love that guy.
573	576	Dude, you totally... Oh, shit, I gotta go. Damn.
576	578	About to go see Ellen in a little bit.
578	580	Going now? Late-night action, huh?
580	581	Dude, you know how it goes.
581	583	Does your girlfriend know about all these late-night visits?
583	585	It's like an unspoken agreement. Yeah.
585	588	It's like a completely and utterly unspoken agreement.
588	590	If you knew her, if you knew who I was dealing with...
590	592	you wouldn't be saying this shit.
592	594	There's nothing you can't do with this woman...
594	596	straight up and down. I've done every single thing...
596	598	I could possibly create. I've literally lubed up...
598	600	and made love to the arches of her feet. All right.
600	601	- Wow! - Yeah.
601	603	- Foot fuck! - That's sick, man.
603	605	- Wow. - That is not sick.
605	607	- I will give you sick. - Oh, shit.
607	610	I was sleeping with a woman recently, she had the...
610	613	- Her tits were unbelievable. - Oh, man, I love titties.
614	616	And so we're doing it and I'm about to finish...
616	618	and her dog starts licking my ass.
619	623	I swear to God, I have to decide, do I finish or do I stop the dog?
623	625	I know your nasty ass. He finished.
625	627	I finished. And then I stole the dog.
629	630	No, I didn't, but...
630	633	You know, sometimes, Amy and I would make love...
633	635	till it was almost like we weren't two people...
635	638	but we were two spirits or something.
638	641	Our souls were connected in this way, I can't describe it.
641	645	Time stood still. It was like we were sharing the same heart.
645	649	Stop, man! Why do you always come and kill the vibe with those things?
649	651	"Sharing the same heart," that's like some...
651	652	Britney Spears shit, man.
652	655	This is three grown ass men, don't nobody want to hear that shit.
655	657	Yeah, man, come on, nobody wants to hear that shit.
657	660	Thank you, Andy. Dude, you broke up two years ago.
660	662	- You get over it at some point. - Two years, man.
663	664	You need to get past that...
664	667	because no ass is worth thinking that much about...
668	669	I always say.
669	671	Andy, do me a favor.
671	674	Would you please help him redeem himself by telling a real sex story?
674	675	Yes.
677	680	I don't... You know what, I'm a gentleman and I don't...
680	682	I don't kiss and tell.
682	685	Fuck it, I raise you. Nastiest shit you've ever done.
685	687	I'm talking about nasty.
688	689	Wow.
690	693	So many stories are running through my head right now.
695	696	I dated this girl...
697	700	for a while, and she was really a nasty freak.
700	705	She just loved to get down with sex all the time.
705	708	She was like, any time of day, she was like:
708	711	"Yeah, let's go. I'm so nasty."
711	712	And I'd be nailing her.
712	713	- Oh, shit. - She'd be like:
714	716	"Oh, you're nailing me. Cool."
716	720	- She talk dirty to you? - She loved to dirty-talk.
720	722	Totally into it. She'd be like:
723	727	"Yeah, let's screw, let's... I wanna fuck."
728	730	God, it was so dirty.
731	735	She'd be like, "Me so horny, me love you long time."
735	736	So...
736	739	- So what were the titties like? - Yeah, describe her...
739	741	Yeah, she had great tits.
741	744	No, I mean, like, detailed. Did she have, like, you know...
744	746	- ...them little pink teeny nipples. - Oh, yeah.
746	749	Or like the long National Geographic nipples.
749	751	You have like the bumpy Braille nipples, the Stevie Wonders.
752	753	Yeah, they were nice.
753	756	You know, when you, like, you grab a woman's breast and it's...
757	759	And you feel it and...
760	764	it feels like a bag of sand when you're touching it.
765	766	Bag of sand?
768	770	You know what I mean. Why don't we just play?
771	772	Why don't you just deal the cards?
772	774	What are you talking about?
774	776	Have you ever felt a breast before, man?
776	777	Yes.
777	780	- Dude, are you gay? - No, I'm not gay.
780	781	I've been with tons of women.
782	784	I touched a guy's balls at Hebrew school once.
784	786	Dude, it's not a big deal. You like to fuck guys.
786	788	I'm cool. I got friends who fuck guys, in jail.
788	790	No, I'm not gay.
790	793	No, I've borked a lot of women in my day.
793	794	You've "borked"?
794	797	Hold up. Yo, answer this question:
798	799	Are you a virgin?
801	802	Are you a virgin?
803	805	Yeah, not since I was 10.
805	807	It all makes sense. You're a virgin.
808	810	- I am... Shut up. - How does that happen?
810	812	He's a fucking virgin.
812	815	I knew it. That makes so much sense, man. Look, he's a virgin.
815	817	- You guys are hilarious. - All right, come on, don't be mean.
817	819	I'm not being mean. I'm trying to help the partner out.
820	821	I'm trying to say I wanna get you laid, dude.
821	823	I understand what's going on.
823	825	You guys are so up your asses.
826	829	From now on, your dick is my dick. I'm getting you some pussy.
839	844	A bag of sand! Come on, man! You could do better than that.
844	848	God, me so horny? Me so stupid!
854	855	Oh, come on.
859	861	It's gonna be fine. They don't even remember.
861	863	Those guys are cool.
871	872	This is gonna be bad.
874	875	Yeah, well, virgin's not a dirty word.
875	877	You know what's a dirty word, is asshole...
877	879	and that's what you guys are.
879	882	You know, I may not have had sex, but I could fuck you up.
884	885	Yeah.
891	892	Come on.
895	897	- Hey, David. - Hey, Andy.
900	902	- What's up? - Cal, good morning.
908	909	- Hey, Andy. - Hey.
909	911	We're gonna have to get you some punani.
914	917	Andy, it's going down, partner. We're gonna be...
919	922	This for you, partner, this for you.
922	925	Waves of them coming at you on Friday, Saturday.
925	927	By Sunday, your nuts gonna be drained.
928	931	Hey, Andy, don't let him bother you. It's okay not to have sex.
932	934	Not everybody is a pussy magnet.
934	938	- What are you? 25? - I'm 40.
938	940	Holy shit, man. You've got to get on that.
941	945	Life isn't about sex. Life is about children and passion.
945	946	Yeah.
946	948	- And spirit. - Yeah, life's about passion.
949	951	It's not about fucking and balls and pussy.
951	954	It's about love. It's about people.
955	958	- It's about connection. - It's all about connections.
958	962	It's not about cock and ass and tits and butthole pleasures.
962	964	It's not about butthole pleasures at all.
964	967	It's not about this rusty trombone and dirty Sanchez.
967	970	- Please stop. - And Cincinnati bowtie.
971	975	And your pussy juice cocktail and this shit-stained balls.
975	977	- Mooj, just please stop. - Just relax...
977	979	All right. That's enough, party's over.
980	981	Let the virgin get back to work.
986	987	Andy!
987	989	Andy, come on. We were just kidding.
990	991	Pointless.
991	993	Andy, nobody cares that you're a virgin.
993	995	Don't be such a baby.
995	998	They were just having fun. They didn't mean anything.
998	999	- Get away from me, David. - Wait a minute.
1000	1001	- Stop following me! - Hold up.
1005	1007	- Hold on. - I'm gonna have to quit my job now.
1007	1008	You don't have to quit your job.
1008	1010	You know what, I don't wanna go out with you guys.
1010	1012	- Fine. - Okay? I don't need your help.
1012	1014	Okay, fine, you don't have to go out with us if you don't want.
1014	1017	You know what, I respect women, I love women.
1017	1020	I respect them so much that I completely stay away from them.
1021	1023	- Okay. - I have a very fulfilling life.
1027	1030	And now, I am making your silver pants blue.
1031	1033	Get some roadburn, come on!
1034	1036	Come on, sucker!
1036	1039	# Now, pretty ladies around the worid #
1040	1042	# Got a weird thing to show you #
1043	1045	Oh, my God!
1049	1052	Hey, Will and Grace, back to work.
1052	1054	Hey, Haziz, can you just give us a second?
1054	1056	We're just kind of in the middle of something.
1056	1058	I'm on my break, okay?
1058	1060	Fuck off, Haziz. Leave us alone, all right?
1060	1063	- Fuck off? Fuck you! - Fuck you!
1063	1065	- Fuck you! Fuck off. - Fuck off.
1065	1066	I'm gonna kick you in the nuts, asshole.
1066	1070	Hey, hey! Watch the language, okay? I have a family.
1070	1071	Watch how you talk to me!
1071	1074	It's a free country, Bambi. I can smoke out here if I want to.
1074	1075	Smoke my pole.
1075	1078	- You are a very unkind man. - Get inside!
1078	1079	This is not professional.
1079	1081	Paula, this asshole over here...
1082	1083	- It's okay. - Paula!
1083	1086	It's all right. Come on. You know, it's just...
1086	1088	So, how could this not have happened?
1088	1090	It just never happened.
1091	1094	When I was young, I tried, and it didn't happen.
1095	1098	And then I got older and I got more and more nervous...
1098	1102	because it hadn't happened yet. And I got kind of...
1103	1105	weirded out about it. Then it really didn't happen...
1105	1109	and then, I don't know, I just kind of stopped trying.
1109	1111	Do you want to give it another shot?
1111	1113	Maybe it's too late.
1114	1117	Sometimes I feel that it is just too late for me.
1118	1119	No, that's crazy.
1120	1123	You're 40 years old. You know, 40 is the new 20.
1123	1125	You wanna spend the next 60 years of your life...
1125	1126	never experiencing sex?
1126	1128	And not just sex, but love...
1128	1133	and a relationship, and laughing and cuddling and all that shit.
1134	1135	I don't know.
1137	1140	- I wouldn't know what to do. - Look, you gotta take a risk.
1140	1141	You gotta risk it. Look at me.
1141	1143	I went out with this girl for four months...
1143	1145	and it was the greatest...
1146	1148	greatest thing in my life.
1149	1152	Until she went down on this guy in an Escalade, I think.
1153	1155	And, you know, instead of saying:
1155	1158	"Okay, what am I doing that caused this behavior?"...
1158	1160	I dumped her. Stupid decision.
1160	1163	I spent the last two years of my life regretting it.
1163	1164	Why don't you get her back right now?
1165	1167	Because she's dating this pot dealer.
1167	1168	Stupid horrible decision.
1168	1172	But, hey, that's her journey, you know. I gotta respect that.
1172	1173	I gotta give her the space.
1173	1177	She wants to be some immature little bitch and blow everybody...
1177	1179	- ...that's love, man. - It sounds horrible.
1179	1181	Of course it's horrible. It's suffering...
1181	1184	and it's pain and it's... You know, you lose weight...
1184	1185	and then you put back on weight...
1186	1188	and then you call them a bunch of times...
1188	1191	and you try and email and then they move or they change their email...
1191	1193	but that's just love.
1193	1195	Do you realize that this is the first time...
1195	1197	we've spoken for more than, like, 30 seconds?
1197	1199	Uh-huh.
1199	1202	- It's kind of nice. - Come out with us this weekend.
1203	1205	No pressure. We'll just have a good time.
1205	1208	Okay, yeah, I will. I'll give it a shot.
1208	1209	Great.
1209	1211	But I'm not going to have sex with anybody.
1211	1214	Good, sex should be the last thing on your mind.
1226	1228	Logjam. Hi.
1234	1235	Shit.
1238	1240	Oh, God.
1244	1245	Sorry.
1247	1248	See you later. Thanks for the dance.
1258	1260	I'm okay. It's all right.
1266	1268	Oh, come on, bus!
1275	1277	Oh, come on, dogs!
1280	1282	Shit! You gotta be kidding me.
1298	1302	I mean, I'm kind of nervous. I never had oral sex before.
1302	1307	Jennifer told me how to do it. It's gonna kick ass.
1313	1315	What are you doing?
1315	1317	Okay, just... We're almost there.
1318	1320	We have one. Houston, we have one.
1321	1323	You'll pull my fucking hair out!
1323	1325	- We did it. - God!
1325	1327	Oh, my God, you came in your pants.
1327	1330	- What did you do? - I had some Cream of Wheat.
1330	1333	- You know what else is sexy? - What?
1333	1335	- Me... - Yeah?
1335	1336	...sucking...
1337	1340	on your...
1341	1342	toe.
1342	1344	- That's what you want to suck on? - Yeah.
1344	1348	- It's just so big and thick. - Okay.
1350	1351	Yeah.
1354	1355	That tickles.
1356	1358	I'm sorry. Oh, no.
1358	1360	- Your nose is bleeding. - You think?
1360	1363	- I'm sorry. - I'm hot.
1363	1365	But, now, you can't have any of this.
1366	1368	You should just give up forever!
1377	1378	Cal, what do you think? Is this too yellow?
1379	1380	No.
1380	1382	What's Curious George like in real life?
1382	1383	Come on, man.
1393	1395	Wow, this is pretty crowded.
1396	1399	Yeah. Well, it's $9 beer night.
1400	1401	Okay, look now.
1401	1403	So, this is what's about to happen, all right?
1404	1406	You about to go run down some drunk chicks, all right?
1406	1409	And don't confuse that with tipsy. We talking about drunk.
1409	1411	I want vomit in the hair, bruised-up knees.
1411	1412	A broken heel is a plus.
1412	1414	That's what you want to find, okay?
1414	1417	No, Dave already told me I didn't have to have sex tonight.
1417	1418	And now he's gone, so...
1418	1420	Dude, just stop thinking for a minute, all right?
1420	1422	You ain't got to think on this one.
1422	1424	All you got to do is use your instinct.
1424	1425	Show me your instincts.
1425	1428	My head, my heart. I follow my heart.
1428	1431	Now, I'm gonna show you this one time, all right?
1431	1434	Instincts. Show me your instincts.
1434	1436	- Show me your instincts. - They're right here.
1437	1439	Own your instincts.
1439	1442	All you doing is using your instinct. That's it.
1442	1444	That's how a tiger know he got to tackle a gazelle.
1445	1446	There's a code written in his DNA.
1447	1448	- It says, "Tackle the gazelle." - Okay.
1448	1451	And believe it or not, in every man, there's a code written that says:
1452	1453	- "Tackle drunk bitches." - No.
1454	1457	You know what, I don't feel comfortable...
1458	1461	hitting on drunk "bitches," you know.
1461	1462	I don't think that's right.
1462	1463	Okay, hold up.
1463	1466	First of all, you making it out to be some kind of bad thing.
1466	1468	I didn't use bitches in a derogatory sense. You did.
1469	1470	It just does... This doesn't feel right.
1470	1473	Of course it don't feel right. What has felt right for you didn't work.
1473	1476	You need to try some wrong, dawg.
1478	1480	Okay, how do I tell which ones are drunk?
1481	1482	Now you're talking all right. Check this out.
1482	1484	- You see this redhead over here? - Where?
1484	1488	- With the big old titties. - I'm not gonna stare at a woman.
1488	1490	Dawg, I'm not telling you to stare at nobody.
1490	1493	I'm telling you to use your peripherals. Now look at me.
1493	1495	- See. Look. See? - Yeah.
1495	1497	I'm not looking at you.
1497	1500	- No. I'm looking at... - You're looking at her?
1502	1505	- What do you want me to do? - I want you to use your peripherals.
1506	1508	See? I'm not looking at you.
1509	1513	No. See, I'm looking at the redhead at 3:00 with the big titties.
1513	1516	You see her, racked up right there, see her?
1516	1518	- Yes. - Yeah.
1518	1521	- You find one with the peripherals. - Okay.
1522	1525	You see, over by the post.
1526	1527	It looks like a...
1527	1529	It's either a ficus...
1529	1531	It might be a rubber tree plant.
1531	1534	All right, if you're making a joke, dawg, it's not funny.
1534	1536	I see a blonde and she's very pretty.
1536	1539	Better, okay. All right.
1539	1541	- Now with your peripherals... - Yeah.
1541	1544	...you got to scope out a hot, drunk chick.
1544	1545	And then you should make your move.
1545	1547	- Okay? All right. - Yes.
1547	1550	And remember, it's more important that she's drunk than she's hot.
1550	1552	For this first one. Go get her. Peripherals, though.
1553	1554	All the way.
1555	1556	All peripherals.
1563	1565	That boy is stubborn.
1568	1571	Hi, I'm Andy. You look comfortable.
1571	1574	Can I get you another cocktail?
1574	1575	Too drunk.
1575	1578	- But you got the right idea. - But clinically alive.
1580	1581	- Hey! - Yo!
1582	1584	I'm having trouble finding the drunk people.
1584	1586	- You want to know where there's one? - Yeah.
1586	1590	I. I, Captain Yellowshirts.
1591	1593	Okay. Have a good one.
1594	1595	- Yo! - What?
1595	1598	I met a girl and she's here with a bachelorette party...
1598	1600	and they invited us to party with them.
1600	1603	- Okay, that's good. - It's so good...
1603	1605	because no one is hornier than a girl...
1605	1608	who's about to watch her friend get married to a guy.
1608	1609	It's so funny.
1613	1617	So we just decided because this is my last night as a free woman...
1617	1620	before I marry Dan, that we would just wig out.
1621	1622	We're wigging out!
1623	1626	You guys are hilarious.
1627	1629	Wait a minute.
1629	1632	Yes, Mr. President. Yes, the erection results are in.
1633	1636	Hey, guys, look, it's Dr. Zeus' penis.
1637	1638	I really mean this.
1639	1642	Hey, everybody, who wants penis cake?
1642	1643	I do.
1643	1647	- She does. - Hey, you guys, Betty Cocker.
1649	1650	What a good guy. What a...
1650	1652	Dan, the guy Robin's marrying...
1652	1656	is such a good guy.
1656	1657	He sounds like a good guy.
1657	1660	I hated him for like two years 'cause he cheated on me.
1661	1662	- Oh. - But...
1664	1667	he's really changed now.
1668	1671	- He's a really good guy now. - Your friends seem nice.
1671	1673	You have really kind eyes, you know that?
1674	1677	Thanks. Your hat has sequins.
1680	1681	Mmm.
1684	1685	Mmm.
1691	1693	- Your hands are on my belt. - What?
1694	1696	- Your hands are on my belt. - I'm sorry.
1696	1697	It's good.
1698	1699	You're cute.
1699	1701	This is kind of lame. You wanna get out of here?
1701	1703	Okay, yeah.
1708	1709	- Yeah. - Fuck.
1710	1711	- Come on. - Okay.
1717	1718	You wanna drive?
1718	1721	I don't have a car with me here, so...
1721	1723	Cars just suck.
1725	1726	I'm driving.
1727	1728	Are you drunk?
1728	1730	No, I didn't have anything to drink.
1730	1732	- Blow into this? - Okay.
1737	1741	- What is this? - The judge recommended I get one.
1747	1751	- Whoa, okay. Wow. - That's fast.
1753	1755	- Okay. - Come on, you're in the lasso.
1758	1760	# Missy be puttin' it down #
1760	1761	# I'm the hottest round #
1761	1763	# I told y'all mother-uh #
1763	1764	# Y'all can't stop me now #
1764	1765	# Listen to me now #
1765	1767	# I'm lastin' 20 rounds #
1767	1768	# And if you want me, people #
1768	1770	# Then come on get me now #
1771	1775	And Dan's like, "You're such a B-I-T-C-H, bitch!"
1776	1779	And I'm like, "You're the bitch, bitch."
1779	1781	- You know? - Yeah.
1781	1782	What was your name again?
1783	1784	- Andy. - Andy.
1784	1789	Let me tell you something, Andy. Don't ever be named Dan.
1789	1792	Dan rhymes with man, and men jerk off.
1792	1794	And he was a jerk-off.
1794	1796	- Do you know what I mean? - Look out! The car!
1797	1800	- Wow. - I like you.
1800	1802	You're not a...
1804	1805	Ugh.
1805	1808	I think I ate some bad shellfish sandwich or something.
1809	1811	- You're cute. - No.
1818	1821	- That tasted good. - That tasted like shellfish.
1822	1825	Look out! Sorry.
1826	1827	Watch it!
1829	1832	- Do you think I'm pretty? - Oh, yes.
1832	1834	Oh, God, yes!
1835	1838	- You're not looking at me. - Yes, you're pretty.
1838	1840	- You're not looking at me. - Yes, you're pretty.
1840	1842	Do you think I'm pretty? Look at me.
1842	1845	- Look at me! - I'm looking! You're pretty!
1846	1848	God, I just wanna live!
1850	1852	God, I hope I get my period soon.
1852	1856	- I am in a bad mood. - Okay.
1856	1859	I'm so tired.
1859	1861	Hey, whoa!
1862	1864	Oh, God! Turn away!
1865	1867	Hey, get off the wheel.
1869	1871	You're not gonna get in my pants acting like that.
1871	1873	I'm starving.
1873	1876	Let's get some fucking French toast.
1878	1881	- Okay, here we are. - Oh, God, we made it.
1881	1883	Home sweet home.
1884	1886	Oh, mommy!
1890	1893	- Are you okay? - The fucker came out of nowhere.
1895	1897	Okay. We're okay.
1900	1902	Are you okay?
1902	1904	Well, are you... What's the matter?
1910	1911	I'm sorry.
1912	1915	That's okay. I think I kind of had that coming.
1916	1918	I'll still have sex with you if you want.
1918	1922	You know what, I think I'm gonna pass on the sex, if you don't mind.
1922	1924	At least I don't have to work out tomorrow.
1925	1927	- Did you have a daiquiri tonight? - Yeah.
1927	1928	I thought you might.
1928	1930	It was a very bad night.
1932	1933	Yeah, laugh.
1933	1935	You know what, you guys wouldn't be laughing right now...
1935	1939	if some girl had just vomited shellfish sandwich into your mouth.
1940	1942	You know what, you're right, it's my bad.
1942	1944	Let me apologize to you first of all...
1944	1948	for not mentioning in detail that when you pick up a drunk woman...
1948	1951	who's falling down on her way out of the bar...
1951	1953	- ...that you should probably drive. - I drive a bike.
1954	1957	Okay, Mr. Schwinn-fucking-Armstrong, who asked you to drive a bike?
1957	1959	You know what, I'm not the only person in the worid...
1959	1961	who rides a bike.
1961	1963	Yeah, everyone rides a bike, when they're fucking six.
1963	1966	Why don't you kiss something?
1966	1969	Because this is over, you guys, okay?
1969	1970	Can I just interject for a second?
1971	1972	Let me just say...
1972	1974	you're putting the pussy up on this pedestal.
1974	1976	You're just building the pussy up, man.
1976	1977	What are you even talking about?
1978	1980	"Building the pussy up," what does that mean?
1980	1984	You making the pussy into this great big Greek goddess named Pussalia...
1984	1986	and what you're doing is...
1986	1989	you're psyching yourself into thinking it's some impossible feat.
1989	1990	Yeah, I think you're right.
1990	1992	I'm putting the pussy up on a pedestal.
1992	1994	- Right. - That's it.
1994	1996	It's "Pussalia," right?
1996	1998	- Look where you going. - I don't wanna say the word anymore.
1998	2001	- Say what word? - "Pussy." I don't wanna say it.
2001	2003	Fuck it. "Pussy" is a scientific word.
2003	2005	Dude! New pants, man.
2006	2007	You know what, Dave?
2007	2009	You know, you said there wasn't gonna be any pressure at all.
2010	2011	- I'm not pressuring you. - Excuse me.
2011	2013	Can one of you guys help me, please?
2013	2014	No hablo English, lady.
2016	2018	I actually am helping a customer right now.
2018	2021	- Okay, well... - I'm on break.
2021	2023	But our stock supervisor is very knowledgeable.
2023	2026	He can answer all of your questions and he'd love to help you.
2026	2027	Thank you.
2027	2029	- Have a nice day. - You, too.
2029	2034	- Great, okay. Hi, I'm Trish. - Hi, Andy is my name.
2034	2037	- This one looks pretty good. - You don't wanna buy that VCR.
2038	2039	I don't?
2039	2040	No, actually to be totally honest with you...
2040	2042	you don't wanna buy any VCR.
2042	2044	It's a dead technology.
2044	2048	It's like getting an eight-track player.
2048	2050	- Yeah. - Or a Betamax.
2050	2052	You know what, actually I'd recommend this one.
2052	2054	This is a dual.
2054	2057	You've got the VCR and DVD combo.
2057	2060	So, you know, that technology would be probably pretty good for...
2061	2062	- Six months or so? - Yeah.
2062	2063	That's good.
2063	2065	At best. Sorry.
2065	2068	- No. - As good as it gets.
2068	2069	Okay, that sounds good, then.
2069	2070	Okay, all right.
2071	2072	- It's perfect. - Sorry.
2072	2074	Coming through.
2074	2075	Okay.
2075	2078	God, you know, it's so funny, I work right across the street...
2078	2079	and I've never been in this place.
2080	2081	- Really? Where at? - Yeah.
2081	2084	The "We Sell Your Stuff On eBay" store.
2084	2086	- Yes. - And that's the name?
2086	2089	Yeah, I was looking for something...
2089	2092	...you know, obvious. So I chose that.
2092	2094	I don't understand. So, what, you do what?
2094	2096	Well, I take the stuff that you don't want...
2096	2099	and then I "sell" it on eBay.
2099	2101	But you don't actually sell anything in the store?
2102	2104	No. I don't.
2104	2107	So why do you have a store?
2107	2108	I don't know.
2108	2111	No, I think it's because, you know, I wanna maybe look professional...
2111	2114	and not like a crazy person who's just gonna steal all your shit.
2114	2117	Sure. I didn't mean anything by that.
2117	2118	No, it's okay.
2118	2122	You know what, you should come by sometime if you want, you know...
2122	2124	see it for yourself, check it out.
2124	2126	I'll check out your empty store.
2126	2129	Yeah, it's the one across the street that's not empty.
2130	2132	Here's my number. So...
2132	2135	- All right. - So, just anytime.
2135	2138	Why do I need your number if you're across the street, though?
2140	2143	I don't really have a good answer for that, Andy. I just...
2143	2145	- Sorry. - Just giving it to you.
2145	2148	So I'll write you up, and I'll meet you over at the register.
2148	2150	- Okay. - And check you out... Check out.
2150	2151	- Okay, see you over there. - Okay.
2151	2152	Okay.
2153	2155	- Awful chatty. - Hey...
2155	2157	Look, I think she gave me her number.
2157	2160	She wrote down her number, but I think she gave me her number.
2160	2161	- No, she gave you. - Dude, man.
2161	2163	See, you still mad at me?
2163	2165	- No, I was never. - Right, you see what I mean?
2165	2167	Yeah, we gonna celebrate it, man. Yeah.
2167	2168	- This is pretty cool. - Yeah.
2168	2170	- Unbelievable. - Come on, give him some credit, man.
2170	2172	The man pulled a number.
2172	2174	It's just... I was in... I can't believe that happened.
2174	2176	What you did with you's own hand.
2176	2178	Man, she just gave me her number.
2178	2183	That's great, man. I'm telling you, love is a mysterious fig.
2183	2184	It is.
2184	2187	Okay, here's a question. When should I call her?
2187	2189	- You like her? - Yeah.
2189	2190	You definitely don't want to call her.
2190	2192	When is the next Olympics?
2192	2193	So what you just got to do is...
2193	2195	just get you a bunch of these hood rats...
2195	2197	run through them, just knock them out.
2197	2198	Boom, boom, boom.
2198	2200	And once you've done slayed like 20, 30 of them hood rats...
2200	2203	now you ready to go up to the upper echelon type ho.
2203	2205	- You know what I mean? - I'm not a big ho runner.
2205	2207	My uncle used to drive a ho runner.
2207	2209	Screw these analogies. What he's saying is...
2209	2211	you are going to be so bad at sex the first time...
2211	2213	you don't want to have sex with someone you like...
2213	2216	'cause they'll think you're a weirdo for being so lame at it.
2216	2218	You want to have sex with hood rats first...
2218	2220	so that by the time you get to the girl you do like...
2220	2224	you're not terrible at sex, you'll be mediocre at it.
2224	2225	Probably still pretty bad, though.
2225	2228	Let's put it up for my man for pulling that number.
2228	2230	- Way to go, man. - Politicked his ass off.
2230	2232	- You did politic. - Thanks a lot.
2233	2235	Like a train, round the bend. You ready?
2269	2270	Yeah.
2271	2272	- I can't. - Do it.
2272	2274	- I can't pee in public. - Gotta do it.
2274	2275	I've got a mental block about it.
2276	2279	- Come on, do it. - I'm shy!
2283	2286	I peed in public!
2286	2288	- Let me out. - I can't hear what you're saying.
2288	2291	- I don't want to be in here. - It's a soundproof room.
2292	2294	- Just learn the techniques. - Right on, man.
2295	2297	You guys, this is not funny!
2328	2329	Hello.
2336	2337	Hey, what you watching?
2338	2340	- Dawn of the Dead, man. - Great.
2340	2342	The store is slow. Paula's gone.
2342	2344	- Yo, is Paula back? - No. She's not here.
2345	2347	- She said we can't watch this in here. - You sure?
2347	2349	I know. Can I ask you something in confidence?
2349	2351	I know this is gonna sound weird.
2352	2354	Am I good-looking?
2354	2355	Do you think a woman will find me attractive?
2355	2357	Oh, my God!
2358	2360	- Oh, my God, the blood just... - Okay, never mind.
2361	2362	Wait, Andy. Hold up.
2362	2365	Listen, this is embarrassing for me. This is hard to talk about.
2366	2368	- Are you ready for my honest answer? - Yes.
2368	2371	Yeah. I think you're a good-looking cat.
2372	2373	I don't think that anybody knows it...
2373	2375	and I don't think anybody can see it.
2375	2376	Well, that's why I'm asking you.
2376	2379	You seem really well-groomed and really put together.
2379	2381	I mean, look, dude. You think this was an accident?
2382	2384	All of this right here? Premeditated, partner.
2384	2388	You gotta highlight your attributes, like a diamond in the rough.
2388	2390	You willing to make some sacrifices?
2390	2391	Absolutely.
2391	2394	You see that whole Teen Wolf thing you got going right there?
2394	2395	You need to wax that right out.
2396	2397	- Does it hurt? - No. Waxing don't hurt.
2397	2399	I mean, not unless you're a bitch. You know what I mean?
2400	2401	It didn't hurt me. I get it done all the time.
2401	2403	What the fuck!
2406	2408	Fuck that nigger up!
2409	2412	Bitch, get out of the room!
2415	2417	This is gonna be good.
2417	2419	- This the one right here, right? - Hi, how are you?
2419	2421	So this is your first time getting body waxed?
2421	2422	Yes, it is.
2422	2424	- Take off your shirt. - Okay.
2428	2430	We're gonna need more wax.
2430	2432	I'm staying. This is gonna be good.
2433	2435	And clear all my appointments in the afternoon.
2436	2437	Here we go.
2437	2439	That feels warm.
2442	2445	I like your sweater. Does that come in a V-neck?
2446	2449	She starts doing his pubes, I'm out of here.
2451	2452	You gonna look good after this, man.
2452	2454	Thanks, man.
2454	2455	- So, ready? - Yeah.
2461	2463	You fucker!
2464	2467	I'm sorry. That's just your job.
2467	2471	- You want me to stop now? - No. It's okay.
2472	2473	Let's do another one.
2473	2475	That one little patch looks sexy though.
2475	2477	- Does it look good? - Yeah, it looks really good.
2478	2481	It looks man-tastic.
2482	2483	Okay.
2485	2488	Wow! I didn't expect that at all. I really didn't expect that.
2489	2491	You got it. The first one is the only one that hurts.
2491	2494	Yeah. Those hairs are pretty deep.
2494	2495	Okay.
2495	2497	- You ready? - Yup.
2501	2503	Sucker motherfucker!
2503	2505	You shithead! I hate you!
2505	2507	I hate you so much!
2508	2510	That one hurt.
2510	2512	That one hurt just as much as the first one.
2512	2514	- That's great, man. - Man!
2516	2518	One, two, three.
2519	2523	Fuck me!
2524	2527	In the asshole!
2529	2531	- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.
2531	2532	I really don't swear this much.
2532	2534	You know what, I got a weak stomach.
2534	2536	That's all I can really take. I'll see ya'll.
2536	2538	- Jay. - Be tough, Andy, you got it.
2538	2540	- Where did Jay go? - He went to throw up.
2540	2542	- Ready? - Yup.
2542	2543	One, two.
2545	2547	Cocksucker motherfucker!
2547	2549	You pulled on two.
2550	2552	Why didn't you pull on three?
2552	2553	Freddy pie hole!
2555	2557	No! Kelly Clarkson!
2562	2564	Ya'll done or ya'll...
2564	2565	- That's fucked up. - Oh, shit falls!
2565	2566	That's fucked up.
2569	2571	I hate you.
2571	2574	Stop smiling, you jerk!
2574	2575	You pussy.
2575	2577	Oh, God. What's next?
2578	2580	- You're doing the nipple. - Not the nipple.
2580	2582	- Come on. - Not the nipple.
2582	2583	Please, Cal, hold my hand.
2584	2587	- You kidding me, man? - Hold my goddamn hand, man.
2587	2589	- Do it! Just hold. - Okay, here we go.
2591	2592	Ready?
2592	2594	No. Yup.
2594	2596	One, two, three.
2596	2599	Nipple fuck!
2600	2602	Mika, you should burn in hell!
2603	2606	Okay, all right. No, seriously, I think I'm done.
2606	2608	I think we're done. I think that's good.
2610	2612	You know what, guys...
2612	2614	this is not a good look for me!
2615	2616	You look like a man-o'-lantern.
2616	2618	Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you.
2638	2640	- Thank you very much. - You're welcome.
2640	2641	- Thank you. - Thanks.
2642	2644	Andy, I owe you an apology, man.
2644	2647	I wasn't very nice to you for the past two-and-a-half years.
2647	2649	You were nice to me.
2649	2651	No, I was... I thought you were really boring and...
2651	2654	I kind of thought you were a serial killer.
2655	2656	I'm not joking.
2657	2660	- Hey! - Sorry. Shoot. Sorry, sorry.
2660	2662	Don't worry. There's a lot of padding in these.
2662	2665	I could hurl it off the balcony, it would be fine.
2665	2666	- Yeah. It will be fine. - We couldn't break this...
2666	2668	- ...if we tried. - No problem.
2668	2670	Look, you shouldn't listen to Dave and Jay, okay?
2670	2673	Those guys are crazy. You should listen to me, okay?
2673	2676	Look, there is a hot-ass girl who works right there.
2676	2679	There she is, in the bookstore. You should ask her out, man.
2681	2683	Something wrong with her underpants.
2683	2685	Yeah, they're not in my mouth.
2685	2687	You know, I kind of...
2688	2690	like the woman from the eBay store.
2690	2691	That's great, but...
2691	2693	you're not gonna get with anyone...
2693	2694	unless you play the odds on this, man.
2695	2696	You need to plant a lot of seeds.
2696	2700	It's like this. When I was growing pot, I realized...
2701	2704	- ...that the more seeds I planted... - Thank you.
2704	2706	...the more pot I could ultimately smoke.
2706	2709	I think I have all the advice that I can handle right now.
2709	2710	Don't get bitter.
2711	2713	I'm not bitter. I almost lost a nipple, okay?
2714	2715	That was Jay's idea, okay?
2715	2718	And I wasn't going to say anything, but waxing your chest is...
2718	2721	like the gayest thing you could possibly do, okay?
2721	2724	Look at me. Looks are not important. Really look at me.
2724	2727	I am ugly as fuck by traditional standards...
2727	2730	but I get with women.
2730	2732	Aren't you curious as to how that's possible?
2732	2734	I am not ugly as fuck.
2734	2736	I didn't say you were ugly as...
2736	2738	- Well, you implied it. - Okay.
2738	2740	It doesn't matter if you're ugly as fuck or you're ugly as shit.
2741	2744	It's about talking to women, and I know how to do that...
2744	2747	because I observe, because I am a novelist.
2748	2750	What? You never told me that before.
2750	2753	That's because I am not an arrogant prick, Andy.
2753	2755	Okay? The problem most men have is...
2755	2757	they don't know how to talk to women.
2757	2761	You know what my problem is? I am not interesting.
2761	2763	What am I supposed to say? "I went to magic camp?"
2764	2766	"I'm an accomplished ventriloquist?"
2766	2769	"I am a seventh-degree imperial yo-yo master."
2770	2772	Do me, yo-yo master.
2772	2776	I want you to do me, 'cause you're the yo-yo guy.
2776	2777	Are you done? Listen.
2777	2779	The problem most men have is...
2779	2783	they just plain straight up have no clue how to talk to women.
2783	2786	Just ask a question, okay? That's it.
2786	2790	Because women do not care about what you have to say...
2790	2791	at all anyway, you know.
2791	2793	And all they want to do is talk about themselves.
2793	2795	So you're just gonna let them do that.
2795	2797	Okay? So remember.
2797	2800	Questions, be cool, and be kind of a dick.
2800	2803	Here, be David Caruso in Jade.
2804	2806	Okay. I know exactly what you're talking about.
2806	2807	You do. That's good.
2809	2811	There she is.
2813	2815	Go plant that seed, man.
2816	2818	Plant it with your finger.
2830	2831	Can I help you?
2833	2835	I don't know. Can you?
2837	2839	Are you looking for something?
2840	2843	Is there something I should be looking for?
2847	2848	We have a lot of books.
2849	2852	So, maybe it depends on what you like.
2857	2858	What do you like?
2859	2862	We have a great section of...
2863	2864	do-it-yourself.
2864	2867	Do you like to "do it yourself"?
2867	2870	Sometimes. I mean...
2870	2874	if the mood strikes.
2875	2877	How is the mood striking you now?
2884	2886	What's your name?
2886	2888	What's your name?
2888	2890	I'm Beth.
2892	2894	Andy.
2895	2896	Andy.
2899	2901	- Don't tell on me, okay, Andy? - I wont.
2903	2905	Unless you want to be told on...
2906	2907	Beth.
2910	2912	Wow. That totally worked!
2912	2914	I literally said nothing. And she found me fascinating.
2914	2916	I would've thought you were doing that for years.
2916	2917	- Should I have asked her out? - No. That's the key.
2918	2919	You wait for it to grow into a plant...
2919	2921	and then you fuck the plant.
2925	2926	Okay.
2927	2928	This is easy.
2929	2930	All right.
2930	2933	Hello, Trish. How you doing? What's going on?
2935	2936	Good joke.
2936	2938	This is a fun conversation.
2938	2940	Just grow a backbone and call her.
2940	2943	She asked you to call her. She wants you to call her.
2950	2951	Hello.
2952	2953	Hey, how you doing?
2955	2957	- How you doing? - I'm well.
2957	2958	Who is this?
2959	2962	- This is James. - James. Do I know you, James?
2964	2966	I was wondering whether you had a few minutes...
2966	2968	to talk about a little laundry detergent.
2968	2970	Are you a telemarketer, James?
2970	2971	Yep.
2971	2973	Are you at the top of a tall building?
2973	2975	Can you get to a roof quickly? Jump off!
2975	2976	I mean, you people are sick.
2976	2978	Get a real fucking job, why don't you?
2978	2980	Go shoot yourself in the fucking head.
2980	2983	Hey, why don't you just, you know, get a knife and run into it?
2983	2984	Why don't you do that, huh?
2984	2986	- Okay. - I'll see you later, James.
2986	2989	- Nice to talk to you. - Fuck your mother, okay? Bye-bye.
2991	2992	Oh.
2995	2997	Hey, man. Got a big box of porn for you.
2999	3001	- Can I come in? - Yeah.
3003	3005	Sweet video game chair.
3009	3011	So what's in the box?
3011	3013	It's my personal collection of erotica.
3013	3014	I want to give it to you.
3015	3017	I think there might be a few tapes in there that just might open up...
3018	3019	Pandora's box of love.
3019	3020	Okay.
3020	3023	Amy and I, we used to watch Harry Twatter...
3023	3025	and we'd put it on the television...
3025	3027	and then act it out as it was going on...
3027	3028	and it was...
3030	3032	She's adorable.
3033	3034	Fucking bitch.
3034	3036	Well, you know, this is really gracious and kind...
3036	3038	and generous and everything.
3038	3040	But I just don't want a big box of porn in my apartment.
3041	3043	There's some really great stuff in here.
3043	3045	Really great movies in here, man.
3046	3047	Hey, did you ever see School of Rock?
3047	3049	- Yeah. - Well, this is...
3049	3050	It's called School of...
3051	3052	You know...
3052	3056	- That's nice. - But it stars Jack Black Cock.
3056	3058	That makes sense.
3058	3060	Dude, here it is.
3060	3062	Boner Jams '03. It's a mixed tape I made.
3062	3066	All these great scenes that I was really into in the summer of 2003.
3067	3069	- I think you'd really dig it. - Yeah. Now I can see that.
3069	3071	This is...
3071	3073	Everybody Loves Raymond.
3073	3074	That's probably not supposed to be...
3074	3076	This is a good show. I just tape it sometimes.
3076	3078	Well, I don't think you understand something, Dave.
3078	3083	I don't want this stuff, okay? Because I don't do that, that much.
3083	3085	- What, masturbate? - Yeah.
3086	3088	Dude, I've jacked it twice since I've been here.
3088	3091	- Are you kidding me? Why not? - It's not a hobby of mine.
3091	3094	Well, then, that's the only hobby you don't have.
3094	3096	No, seriously, I just don't feel comfortable talking about...
3096	3097	You need to. You're wound up.
3098	3099	You're like one of these action figures...
3099	3101	all hermetically sealed in your box.
3101	3103	- You gotta play with... - Don't!
3103	3105	Don't take it out!
3105	3107	I'm sorry. You know what, it's just...
3107	3110	It loses its value if you take it out of its packaging.
3110	3113	I'm just saying, let it out. Give it some air, man. Play with it.
3113	3116	- Take your porn with you. - I'm not taking it.
3116	3118	Take your box-o-porn.
3118	3121	- It's my gift to you. - No. I don't want it.
3121	3122	David, it's not...
3122	3123	Andy, for the last time...
3123	3125	I don't want your giant box of pornography.
3125	3127	No, no, no! Come on, man.
3128	3129	So uncool.
3130	3131	Uncool?
3132	3136	Uncool is trying to give an honest man a big box of porn, Andy.
3137	3139	For the last time, I don't want to watch...
3139	3141	School of Cock with you.
3211	3213	It's nothing official.
3214	3217	Just a little token of my appreciation.
3238	3241	Hi, Andy. I'm gonna talk dirty to you.
3241	3245	I want to have lots of sexy sex with you.
3245	3249	I want to touch your big, fat noodle...
3250	3253	'cause I want to have naughty intercourse with you.
3254	3258	I want you to put your penis on, I mean, in me, Andy.
3258	3261	I want to do lots of, lots of sexy...
3261	3264	hot things with you. Shit.
3265	3268	This really isn't working, Andy. I don't know what to say...
3268	3269	because I am you.
3272	3273	Okay. New tape.
3275	3278	Nothing is ever good enough and it's always our fault.
3278	3280	Hey, you can't speak to your mother like that.
3280	3282	- You do. - She's not my mother.
3287	3289	I heard Dave gave you the box of porn.
3290	3291	Yeah, he did.
3292	3294	You ever watch, like, Primetime Live...
3294	3296	when they take a black light into a hotel room...
3296	3299	and show you all the semen all over the bedspread?
3299	3300	Yeah.
3301	3303	You blind someone with that box.
3304	3305	Could see that thing from space.
3309	3312	This right here, you looking at the Bentley of big screen TVs.
3312	3314	I'm talking about, this is the Rolls-Royce of big screens...
3316	3318	Sometimes, I think these butterflies are in here.
3319	3321	I think he might be fooling us all, though.
3321	3322	Really?
3322	3324	I actually think he might be, like, some genius...
3324	3326	and this is like some big, like, hilarious...
3326	3329	Like he's bored at work and he just wanted to kick up some shit...
3329	3330	so he told us all he's a virgin.
3331	3333	You're seeing that a lot of stuff that's not there.
3333	3335	You're just projecting all over him.
3335	3336	He might be an idiot savant...
3336	3339	but he's not, like, clever enough to go that deep.
3340	3341	But he's got a great body.
3341	3343	- Would you fuck him? - In a New York minute.
3343	3345	- You would fuck him? - Absolutely.
3347	3349	Hey, Andy, what are you doing for lunch?
3350	3352	I don't know. I have a turkey sandwich.
3352	3355	We're gonna go around the corner. I think you should come with us.
3355	3358	There's this great place. A lot of cute giris.
3358	3359	I don't know. Okay.
3360	3362	We brought you a shirt.
3363	3364	This place is pretty fancy.
3366	3367	Something going on?
3367	3369	Hey, who's ready to have some fun?
3371	3372	Hey, guys...
3374	3376	No, don't ignore me. I know what this is.
3376	3379	Within one hour, you'll each have 20 dates.
3379	3382	Don't... Please don't do this. I saw this on Primetime Live.
3382	3384	All right, ninja master.
3384	3386	We've given you all the advice we have to give.
3386	3388	Now you gonna put it in action.
3388	3390	Advice? You guys all gave me different advice.
3390	3392	- He thinks you're a pothead. - I am.
3392	3395	Dude. Hey, partner. What are you whining about?
3395	3397	- You asked for this shit. - No, I didn't.
3397	3399	Will you just quit whining like a bitch?
3399	3402	- I'm not whining like a bitch. - You are whining like a bitch.
3402	3405	And you about to cram like 10 years of pimpage into one day.
3405	3408	- I don't want to cram pimpage. - And after that...
3408	3410	you on my level. Come on.
3410	3412	- Just ask questions. - This is a bad idea.
3415	3417	- Hi. - Hi. How are you?
3417	3418	I'm fine.
3419	3420	Are you fine?
3421	3422	Yeah.
3423	3425	You're fine then?
3425	3428	Are you fucking retarded? What the hell's the matter with you?
3429	3430	Do you want me to be fucking retarded?
3432	3434	When I look into the eyes of the children and the parents...
3434	3435	and they are smiling and saying:
3435	3438	"Thank you, Dr. Montalban, you saved my child"...
3438	3439	it was worth it.
3442	3443	Amy...
3444	3446	- ...what are you doing here? - David.
3447	3449	- And you are Gina? - Gina.
3450	3451	- Hey, what's up? - Nothing.
3451	3454	Look, I'm going to be real honest with you.
3454	3457	It's been a long time since I've been with a man.
3457	3459	Spent a lot of time with the ladies.
3459	3462	Looking to get back up on that pogo stick.
3462	3464	- You know what I'm saying? - Excuse me.
3464	3468	Remember that time when we made love and you cried in my arms?
3468	3470	Please don't reminisce about the times we fucked, please.
3470	3472	- It's so creepy. - Let's go to Paris.
3472	3475	I want to take you underneath the Eiffel Tower and make love to you.
3475	3477	- Cut it out. - Cut what out?
3477	3479	This go to Paris! We've been broken up for like two years, man.
3479	3481	I don't want to date you anymore.
3481	3482	- You're a whore. - I am not a whore.
3482	3484	I just didn't like you.
3484	3485	This is so us.
3487	3489	- Psycho talk. - What?
3489	3491	- You're a good-looking man. - Thank you.
3491	3493	Very pretty. Real soft, delicate features.
3494	3496	You're real feminine, you know, which is good for me...
3496	3499	because that would be a simple sort of transition.
3499	3500	You know what I'm saying?
3500	3503	Maybe throw a little rouge on you, tuck your sac back.
3503	3505	- You game? - No.
3506	3510	You need to stop fucking around with my friend, okay?
3510	3513	Because you're giving him hope, and it's driving the man crazy.
3513	3516	I moved, I changed my e-mail address, my phone number.
3516	3517	He's practically stalking me.
3517	3520	Well, I didn't know all that. So, I'm sorry.
3521	3522	I love Minnesota.
3522	3525	I grew up in a town outside of Minneapolis...
3525	3528	with a population of, like, 500 people. Really small.
3528	3530	Yeah, it's like the Land of a Thousand Lakes.
3530	3533	What about you? You're used to, like, a really big city.
3533	3535	Really... God, yes.
3536	3540	The town that I grew up in was really small. I mean...
3540	3543	you know, it was just so safe. There was no crime.
3543	3546	I mean, a girl could just walk from one end of town to the other...
3546	3549	and just, you know, feel completely safe.
3552	3553	You suppose he's had enough?
3554	3556	Spank bank has once again been filled.
3557	3558	I'll tell you who's the hottest.
3558	3562	You're gonna think I'm crazy. Let me tell you. Gina.
3562	3565	Can't get va-Gina out of my head. Va-Gina all week.
3575	3576	- You know what's a fun game? - Huh?
3576	3578	You take three Excedrin PMs...
3578	3581	and you see if you could whack off before you fall asleep.
3583	3586	You always win is the best part about the game.
3588	3590	- Are you Andy? - Yeah.
3590	3592	Is this yours? Did you write this stuff?
3592	3595	My girlfriend, Jill, found your speed-dating card.
3595	3597	Yeah, right.
3597	3599	God, I've been looking for that speed-dating card.
3599	3601	Thank you so much for bringing it to me.
3601	3603	So, you actually wrote that one girl looked like...
3603	3605	she was "hurting for a squirting"?
3605	3608	Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Hurting for a squirting, I wrote that.
3608	3610	So you wrote "ho fo show."
3611	3614	Yeah, I remember that girl. She was a ho.
3614	3616	Fo show.
3616	3618	Let me show you how this device works.
3618	3620	Right, I'm just looking for a cordless phone.
3620	3622	Yup, it's great. You can do anything, make video diaries...
3622	3626	Hey, Amy, how's it going? How you feeling? I'm great.
3626	3629	I feel fantastic since we broke up.
3630	3631	I feel awesome!
3631	3634	Can you just show me the department where there would be phones?
3634	3636	How have you been? What's been going on...
3636	3638	I bet... Hey, have you been doing a lot of this?
3641	3642	Sir, please, sir.
3642	3643	You are never gonna meet anybody...
3644	3646	with that kind of mentality about women, you sick son of a bitch.
3646	3648	Who the fuck are you to put me on trial?
3648	3650	I've never even met you.
3650	3652	So why don't you back the shit off, all right?
3652	3654	And stop with the inquisition.
3654	3655	That's how you talk?
3656	3657	You know what, I don't have to answer to you.
3657	3659	You ain't my bitch.
3659	3661	Know what I saying?
3661	3663	So, shit, man. Fuck it.
3663	3665	You shouldn't even be hanging out with this pervert.
3665	3667	I don't hang out with him. I work with him and that's it.
3667	3669	I tried to introduce him to a few nice people...
3669	3670	he made a fool of himself.
3670	3672	I don't mess with him, baby. That's not me.
3672	3674	You should keep your ho on a leash.
3674	3676	- Bro, I can't let you... - Hey.
3676	3678	I can't let you be talking to my woman like that, dawg.
3678	3681	- Know what I'm saying? - Bitch is running wild, man.
3681	3684	You miss that ass? That's the ass of a free man.
3684	3686	That ass is going out tonight, maybe to a club.
3686	3688	Maybe to a night club.
3688	3689	Hey, Andy...
3690	3692	- ...take a look at your pal. - Oh, my God.
3692	3694	Yeah, he's performing a public colonoscopy.
3695	3696	Isn't that sweet?
3696	3698	I'm gonna send David home for the day...
3698	3699	and you're gonna fill in for him.
3699	3701	- What? Selling things? - You got that right.
3701	3702	I don't think that's a good idea.
3702	3703	And you're gonna have to talk to people, too.
3703	3705	I know that's a frightening concept to you...
3705	3706	but I think you can handle it.
3707	3708	So get out there and start selling some shit.
3708	3710	...thing for Amy.
3710	3711	- Hold it. - Check it out.
3712	3713	I miss her.
3716	3718	Dude, the floor's the ultimate aphrodisiac.
3718	3720	All you got to do is go make your pick now.
3720	3722	- Come on, man. - Okay.
3723	3725	And you could act a little enthused about it.
3725	3726	Yeah.
3727	3731	That's right. That's right. Gazelle in the pink top.
3732	3733	- Oh, shit. - Hi.
3734	3736	Looks like you're checking out digital cameras.
3736	3738	You know what, he ain't going to do it willingly.
3738	3741	No. We need to, like, really facilitate things a bit more.
3741	3742	- Yo, Andy. - Yeah.
3742	3744	What's up, dude? This is Jay, man.
3744	3745	Hey, Jay.
3745	3747	I am throwing a party tonight.
3747	3748	It's gonna be real mellow, just chilled up.
3748	3750	Now, you really need to be there.
3750	3752	It's gonna be really, really colorful.
3753	3754	Are you free?
3755	3756	Yeah, I think so.
3756	3758	That was a joke, man. I know you're free.
3759	3760	- I'm okay. - Gotta go, man.
3760	3761	All right, bye.
3764	3766	So, tell me, Montel...
3767	3770	why weren't we invited to the party? What are we, Al-Qaeda?
3770	3771	No, hold up.
3771	3773	- No, no. - It's not that kind of party, y'all.
3773	3775	You're not coming to our fucking party either, okay?
3775	3776	Fuck you, okay?
3776	3778	First of all, it ain't that kind of party.
3778	3780	- Go fuck a goat. - Yeah.
3780	3782	Why you always telling me to fuck a goat, man?
3782	3783	Fuck a goat!
3800	3801	Hello?
3803	3804	Hello?
3806	3807	Hello.
3809	3811	Hello. Hi.
3812	3814	- Are you here for Jay's party? - Yes.
3814	3816	I am Jay's party.
3818	3821	You know what, hiring a transvestite prostitute isn't helping me, man.
3821	3823	What? Ain't nobody hired no damn transvestite.
3823	3824	What are you talking about?
3825	3826	She was really nice, incidentally.
3826	3828	If that sister was a transvestite...
3828	3830	that was the Mona Lisa of transvestites.
3830	3832	You got a hummer from the tranny, didn't you?
3832	3836	You know, aren't we owed one now? 'Cause technically we paid her.
3836	3837	Get a dick, man.
3837	3839	Do you guys even like me?
3839	3842	Or is this some sort of cruel joke that you're all in on?
3842	3845	Because I'm not a freak. I'm a good person.
3845	3848	I always thought that Matt Damon was like a Streisand, but...
3849	3851	I think that he's rocking the shit in this one.
3851	3853	Shut up, Dave!
3853	3857	Hold up. Let's just chill on the aggression for a minute.
3857	3861	Look at him. He is such a bad ass.
3862	3864	He looks just like Luke Wilson.
3864	3865	Mmm-hmm.
3865	3867	So you saying she was definitely a man?
3867	3868	Yes.
3868	3870	Okay, well, how do you know that she was a man?
3870	3873	Because her hands were as big as Andr the Giant's.
3874	3876	And she had an Adam's apple as big as her balls.
3877	3879	So you have no proof.
3879	3881	You know what? Just leave me alone.
3881	3883	Just stay away from me. Or I'm gonna tell Paula...
3883	3885	that you're all stealing the recordable CDs.
3886	3888	- Come on. - That's like we were paid to do it.
3888	3890	We did this 'cause we're your friends...
3890	3893	and we didn't think you have the balls to do it yourself.
3893	3894	- Really? - Yeah.
3895	3896	Okay, watch this.
3896	3898	Yo, Andy, it's just CDs, man.
3898	3900	That's a third strike for me, dawg.
3923	3924	Hi.
3925	3927	- Andy. Hi. - Right, yeah.
3927	3929	- You remember my name. - I did.
3929	3932	- How you doing? - I'm great. I like your store.
3932	3934	That's good, yeah. If you have time, look around. It's...
3934	3935	Okay.
3936	3937	How's business been?
3937	3940	You know, it's coming along. I mean, it takes a while.
3940	3943	- Do you want to go out sometime? - Yes.
3944	3946	Yes, I would like that. That would be great.
3946	3950	I think I'm maybe free this weekend, if that's okay.
3950	3953	Or you could call me tomorrow and we can just firm it up.
3953	3955	- Okay. Great. - Great.
3955	3958	Okay, so I'll call you, and yeah, that'll be good.
3958	3960	- How you doing? - Congratulations.
3960	3962	Okay, so I'll... Yeah.
3962	3963	Can I help you?
3964	3966	Yeah, these are wonderful. I'll take these.
3966	3970	Thanks, they are. They're great. The goldfish just crack me up.
3970	3971	Funny.
3971	3972	- Yeah, they are. - Yeah.
3972	3973	- Yeah. - They're cute.
3974	3977	I don't actually sell anything here. I just sell them on eBay.
3977	3979	I don't get it.
3979	3980	Okay.
3980	3983	- Can you help me? - No, you're on your own here.
3983	3986	Good luck to you, and to you. And I'll give you a call.
3986	3989	- Great. Nice to see you. - Great. Thanks for coming in.
3990	3991	Bye.
3992	3994	So, I guess I'll just give you some money...
3994	3996	and you can give me these shoes and...
3996	3999	You know, I know it seems so strange...
3999	4002	Yes. I'd just rather buy them from you straight up.
4002	4004	Yeah, I know. I wish it could be that easy, but...
4004	4007	I wish, too, but you're making it extremely difficult for me.
4007	4009	I'm just trying to get these shoes back to my house...
4009	4011	so I can wear them.
4011	4013	I got a corpse in my way.
4013	4014	Look out. Just kill it.
4014	4017	That's just so not fair that you have blades and...
4017	4019	I'm telling you, man, I feel great.
4019	4021	I'm so... It's like a weight has been lifted.
4021	4025	Celibacy is the way to go, man. Andy had it right, you know?
4025	4027	Look at him. He looks younger than all of us...
4027	4028	but he's 10 years older.
4028	4031	Why? Because he's never had a relationship.
4031	4033	No she-devil sucked his life force out yet.
4050	4052	- Hello? - Hey. Hi. Hello.
4053	4054	Is this Trish?
4055	4057	- Who's calling, please? - This is Andy.
4057	4059	- Hi, Andy. - Hi, how you doing?
4059	4062	- I'm good. How're you doing? - I'm doing great.
4063	4064	So you're gay, now?
4064	4066	No, I'm not gay. I'm just celibate.
4067	4069	I think... I mean, that sounds gay.
4069	4072	I just want you to know that this is the first conversation...
4072	4075	of three conversations that leads to you being gay.
4076	4078	There's this and then in a year it's like, "You know...
4078	4082	"I'm kind of going to wanna get back out there, but I think I like guys."
4082	4085	And then there's the big, "I'm a gay guy now."
4085	4087	- You're gay for saying that. - I'm gay for saying that?
4087	4090	- You know how I know you're gay? - How? How do you know I'm gay?
4090	4093	'Cause you macramd yourself a pair of jean shorts.
4093	4094	You know how I know you're gay?
4094	4096	You just told me you're not sleeping with women anymore.
4096	4097	- You know how I know you're gay? - How?
4098	4101	'Cause you're gay and you can tell who other gay people are?
4101	4102	- Do you know how I know you're gay? - How?
4102	4104	You like Coldplay.
4104	4106	You're dead.
4107	4108	Come on.
4108	4110	Leave my torso alone at least.
4111	4113	I also wanted to call...
4113	4115	and see what night you might want to go out.
4115	4117	I'm actually free tonight.
4119	4123	Okay. Now, I was thinking maybe this weekend, but that's good. Okay.
4123	4124	Great.
4124	4126	Okay, what time do you want to pick me up?
4127	4129	Let's see.
4130	4133	That's actually kind of a problem because I ride a bike.
4133	4135	That's cool. Are you kidding me?
4135	4137	I love getting on the back of a motorcycle.
4137	4139	My boyfriend in college drove a motorcycle.
4140	4141	So, I mean, I'm cool.
4141	4145	Yeah, I bet that was cool. I ride a bicycle.
4147	4148	You know how I know that you're gay?
4148	4149	How?
4149	4152	You like the movie Maid in Manhattan.
4152	4153	- You know how I know you're gay? - How?
4153	4157	I saw you make a spinach dip in a loaf of sourdough bread once.
4157	4158	- You know how I know you're gay? - How?
4158	4161	You have a rainbow bumper sticker on your car that says:
4161	4163	"I love it when balls are in my face."
4164	4165	That's gay?
4165	4166	God damn it!
4166	4169	I'm ripping your head off right now. It's off.
4169	4172	And now I'm throwing it at your body.
4173	4174	Fuck you!
4175	4176	You guys...
4177	4179	she's picking me up in an hour.
4180	4182	Oh, drag, dude.
4182	4185	- She's picking you up from here? - Yeah.
4185	4186	That's fucked up, man.
4186	4188	- Why? - Why?
4189	4192	Seriously. I mean, look at this place, man.
4193	4196	You gotta see this through the eyes of a woman, you know?
4196	4198	What is she going to think when she comes in here? Look.
4198	4201	- He's got a billion toys. - So what?
4201	4204	And more video games than a teenaged Asian kid.
4204	4205	It's all right.
4206	4209	Is that the Six Million Dollar Man's boss?
4209	4210	It's Oscar Goldman.
4210	4212	- Why do you have that? - That's worth a lot of money.
4213	4214	That's much more valuable than Steve Austin.
4215	4219	Well, that may be the case. But none of this shit is sexy, okay?
4219	4221	I'm not trying to be sexy, man.
4221	4222	I mean, seriously, Asia?
4222	4224	You framed an Asia poster?
4224	4226	How hard did the people at the frame store laugh...
4226	4228	- ...when you brought this in? - They did not laugh at me.
4228	4230	- Know why you're gay? - Because you like Asia.
4230	4232	You guys cool it with the gay.
4232	4234	You know, she's on her way over here, okay?
4234	4235	First, you relax, okay?
4235	4239	Just stop calming me down and tell me what I should do.
4239	4241	Okay, we just take everything that's embarrassing...
4241	4242	and we move it out of here.
4242	4244	So it doesn't look like you live in Neverland Ranch.
4252	4253	- Hi. - Hi. How are you?
4253	4254	Good.
4254	4256	So, you wanna head out?
4256	4258	Did you just move in or something?
4258	4260	No. Actually I'm getting new carpet in.
4260	4263	I'm having carpet put in tomorrow, so...
4264	4265	- Well, you know. - Yeah.
4266	4267	- Okay. - Looks good with the floors.
4267	4269	- Yeah. - All right.
4269	4271	I should tear up the hard wood...
4271	4273	and see if there's carpet underneath.
4273	4275	That's never the case.
4278	4280	- This is gonna be fun. - Yes.
4280	4282	You know, I drive by this place every day.
4282	4283	I've never been in before.
4284	4285	I'm glad you came.
4285	4289	You know, I never really go out with nice guys like you.
4290	4292	I think I've avoided nice guys like you my whole life...
4293	4294	at my own peril.
4296	4298	My last boyfriend drank a lot.
4298	4299	Mmm-hmm.
4299	4300	- And so... - This is just punch.
4301	4303	No, it's okay. A little bit's fine.
4303	4306	Buddha punch. I need some Buddha.
4306	4309	Excuse me, miss. Could you gather your team...
4309	4311	and sing happy birthday for my daughter, please?
4330	4333	- That was so good. What? - That was great. Happy birthday.
4333	4335	- It's your birthday, too? - No.
4335	4337	- It's his birthday, too. - No, no, no.
4337	4339	Could you sing for him and bring him a cake?
4340	4341	Happy birthday.
4355	4357	- Thanks a lot. - Happy birthday, Andy.
4374	4377	- You really like kissing, don't you? - Yes.
4380	4381	I really do.
4381	4383	Take off your pants, okay?
4384	4386	- Okay. - Okay.
4388	4390	- Wow, this is really gonna happen. - Oh, yeah.
4391	4392	Thank God.
4393	4397	- Okay, I'm taking off my pants. - Yeah.
4397	4398	Do you need some help?
4399	4402	I think I almost got them. It's hooked on my ankle.
4403	4404	Wow, that's...
4406	4408	Hey, wait. Do you have protection?
4408	4410	I don't like guns.
4413	4414	That's funny.
4414	4417	I have condoms right here. Okay?
4417	4418	- Okay. - There's, you know...
4419	4422	Check the expiration date because they were from when I was married.
4422	4425	And we didn't have sex that often. That's why there are so many, okay?
4425	4426	Okay.
4430	4431	I got them.
4434	4435	How does this go?
4436	4441	Okay. "Roll over the tip and down onto the base."
4443	4444	Over the balls?
4445	4446	It doesn't say.
4449	4451	Do you mind if I use your magnum?
4453	4454	Yeah.
4456	4457	Wow. You got to be kidding.
4458	4460	I am Aquaman.
4462	4463	What is that?
4481	4483	Mom?
4484	4485	What's going on here?
4485	4487	- Who the hell are you? - It's Andy.
4487	4488	Hi, I'm Andy.
4488	4490	God! What are you doing?
4490	4492	Marla, get the fuck out of my room!
4492	4493	You know what...
4493	4495	I cannot believe that you're allowed to have sex when I'm not!
4496	4497	- That is so unfair. - I'm gonna head out.
4498	4499	You should go.
4499	4502	Oh, Jesus! How many times did you just do it?
4502	4503	Oh, my God!
4505	4507	I'm so sorry.
4514	4516	Dude, teach me.
4526	4527	Hotline.
4527	4530	Hi, yes, I'm calling because it's more than four hours...
4531	4534	and your ad said to call if it's been more than four hours.
4534	4536	How much of the medicine have you taken, sir?
4536	4539	I haven't taken any, but your ad said...
4539	4543	that if you've had an erection for more than four hours, you call.
4543	4547	You're only supposed to call if you've taken the medicine.
4547	4550	Okay. I'm sorry. I must not have heard that part.
4550	4553	Yes. If you haven't taken the medicine, you don't call.
4553	4555	Right. I'm sorry. Right.
4555	4557	So, there's nothing you can do?
4557	4559	- I just don't wanna... - There's nothing I can do.
4560	4561	I'm in Bombay, India.
4561	4563	Okay. No, not you personally. I just don't want...
4564	4566	I just don't want to have an erection anymore.
4567	4569	You know, you could have sex.
4569	4570	Okay. Yup.
4571	4575	That's one thing people do when they have an erection.
4575	4577	Yeah, that's not an option. I don't have sex.
4577	4580	Okay, well, then you can masturbate.
4580	4581	I'd rather not masturbate.
4582	4584	If you'd like the erection to go away, you can light a match...
4585	4589	blow out the flame and put the hot ember on your wrist.
4589	4591	And that will focus the brain elsewhere...
4592	4594	- ...and you will lose your erection. - Really? That'd work?
4594	4597	Take your finger and flick your testicle...
4597	4598	and if you do that till it hurts...
4599	4601	- ...your erection will go away. - Okay, all right.
4601	4602	It sounds unpleasant and it is.
4602	4604	It is a trick we use in India.
4604	4608	Okay, those are all good pieces of advice. I really appreciate it.
4608	4610	We appreciate your business.
4610	4612	Oh, no. We didn't get your business...
4612	4616	No, not this time. I guess I didn't need you this time. Thank you.
4644	4647	My goodness, Andy, you are a terrific salesman.
4647	4649	- Thank you. - Gosh, you really got it down.
4649	4651	- Thanks. - And your numbers are good.
4651	4652	Thanks.
4652	4654	I'm going to put you out on the floor full time.
4654	4655	- Really? - Yeah.
4655	4656	Wow. Okay.
4656	4659	Good. We're gonna get you a blue shirt and tie, all right?
4659	4660	Great. Thanks.
4660	4663	You know, Andy, I've been thinking about your problem.
4663	4665	I think I might have a solution for you.
4666	4669	You ever heard of the term "fuck buddy"?
4671	4672	What?
4672	4675	It's a special friend...
4676	4677	who you fuck.
4678	4680	No, haven't heard that term.
4680	4683	When I was a little girl, I developed early.
4684	4687	By the time I was 14, I had this body you're looking at.
4687	4690	- Can you imagine that? - I don't want to, no.
4690	4693	Well, needless to say, a lot of male attention.
4693	4695	Like men, yes.
4695	4699	Especially from our Guatemalan gardener, Javier.
4699	4700	Okay.
4700	4702	You know, Javier...
4703	4708	before he made passionate yet gentle love to me for the first time...
4709	4713	he serenaded me with a beautiful old Guatemalan love song.
4713	4715	Really, that's...
4715	4718	That sounds nice.
4745	4746	Okay.
4748	4749	My goodness.
4749	4752	- I think we better get back to work. - Yeah.
4752	4754	- Yeah, I better go back to work. - Yeah.
4754	4756	- So, okay. - All right.
4756	4758	So, you mull it over and I'll talk to you soon.
4758	4760	- All right, I will. Thank you. - Okay.
4765	4768	What's up, dawg? What happened? How was the date with Trish?
4768	4770	- It was a disaster. - Really?
4770	4773	Yes. I've never been more embarrassed in my life.
4773	4775	Couldn't get the condoms to work.
4776	4778	And one of them exploded on my balls.
4779	4780	And then her kid walked in the room.
4780	4781	Wait. Hold up.
4781	4783	She was hiding the kid from you, dawg?
4783	4784	You know what, it doesn't matter...
4784	4787	because it was going downhill straight from there.
4787	4789	Listen, you don't want no baby-daddy drama.
4789	4790	Trust me on this one, all right?
4790	4792	For all you know, he in prison right now.
4793	4794	Let's say y'all living together.
4794	4797	Next thing you know, you the one going on the 1st and the 15th...
4797	4798	to pick up the government check.
4798	4800	What if he got boys that's on the outside...
4800	4802	and they stalking you?
4802	4804	You see what I'm saying? You got to think, partner...
4804	4805	What the fuck are you talking about?
4805	4808	Here's what you do. You tell her you're a virgin.
4808	4810	You test her with this shit, okay?
4810	4813	Here, tell me. Tell me. This is how it's gonna go. Tell me.
4813	4815	- I'm a virgin. - Sweet.
4815	4819	I like that because you don't have chlamydia.
4820	4823	And I know that, and that shit is everywhere.
4823	4825	What if she laughs at me, though?
4825	4827	Then you punch her in the fucking head if she laughs.
4827	4830	I'm not going to punch her in the head. She's really sweet.
4830	4834	No. I mean, you punch her in her fucking head emotionally.
4834	4837	She's different. She's someone I felt like I had...
4837	4838	a connection with.
4838	4841	All you trying to do right now is bust off this first night.
4841	4844	You got a whole lot of semen back up in you.
4844	4845	I am going to tell her.
4845	4847	- You should totally tell her, man. - I'm going to.
4847	4849	'Cause I watched this movie called Liar Liar...
4849	4852	and the message was, "Don't lie."
4852	4854	And that was a smart movie.
4854	4855	- Yeah, that's the right thing. - Yeah.
4856	4860	Really? All your girlfriends wanted to have sex with virgins, too?
4861	4864	That's funny. I didn't even know you girls talked like that.
4865	4868	I think my first time might be your best time, too.
4869	4870	Well, I knew it. You know what...
4870	4874	I knew that you'd react that way and I knew that...
4874	4878	you would want to lead me through my first sexual encounter...
4879	4883	with all the compassion and care that someone...
4883	4885	would give to their soul mate.
4885	4887	Oh, my God. I'm in trouble.
4890	4891	Hey, Andy.
4892	4893	You watching Survivor tonight?
4894	4896	No, actually I'm going out to dinner with somebody.
4896	4897	Hi.
4897	4899	This is her.
4899	4901	- Trish, this is Joe and Sara. - Hi.
4901	4902	- Hi, Trish. - Hey.
4902	4904	But tape it for me, okay?
4904	4905	- Will do. All right. - Thanks.
4905	4907	- So long. - Bye-bye.
4907	4908	- See you later. - Have a good night.
4908	4911	Yeah, my man's gonna get it on tonight.
4911	4912	Yes, sir.
4912	4914	Yeah, and you better get on me, too.
4915	4917	What is wrong with this woman?
4917	4918	Mercy, mercy, mercy.
4924	4926	I'm so sorry that happened the other night.
4926	4927	No, I'm sorry.
4927	4929	- Oh, my God. - That was me.
4929	4930	No.
4931	4933	Let me... I have something I want to tell you.
4934	4936	Kind of hard to talk about.
4937	4938	But...
4939	4942	you know, there are certain things...
4942	4945	about who I am that...
4945	4948	I'm sorry. I just have to get this off my chest.
4948	4951	I am so sorry, I didn't tell you I had kids.
4952	4954	Yeah, what was that about?
4954	4956	Gosh. You know, that really surprised me.
4959	4961	No, you should have told me probably, but...
4961	4962	I'm sorry. I know.
4962	4964	What do I care if you have a kid?
4964	4966	Well, I have two kids.
4967	4969	Wow. Okay. How old are they?
4970	4971	Six.
4972	4973	Sixteen.
4974	4975	Twenty-one.
4976	4977	Forty-two.
4978	4980	Fifty-six. How many kids do you have?
4980	4982	- I have three. - Okay, three.
4982	4984	Yeah, and one of them has a kid.
4984	4986	A one-year-old.
4986	4988	That's cool. That's great.
4990	4993	- I'm really glad we're doing this. - Me, too.
4998	4999	Listen, Andy...
5000	5003	I don't want to send you running for the hills or anything, but...
5003	5007	I really feel like if we decide to do this again, then...
5009	5013	maybe we should hold off on the physical part for a while.
5015	5017	That is a fantastic idea.
5018	5019	Why didn't I think of that?
5019	5020	- Really? - Totally.
5021	5024	- No sex? - No. Why do that?
5024	5026	Because here's the thing.
5026	5027	From personal experience...
5027	5030	I found that sex can really complicate things.
5030	5033	And what we should be doing right now is getting to know each other.
5033	5034	Yeah.
5034	5036	Well, I never thought you'd go for it.
5036	5038	I'm going for it.
5038	5041	Well, that just is a great, great notion.
5042	5043	Are you serious?
5043	5046	Look at my face. Look at how serious I am.
5046	5048	Can you see my nostrils?
5048	5050	- Yes. - That's serious.
5050	5051	That's more angry.
5052	5054	Yeah, you know what, most guys would be saying:
5054	5057	"Yeah," right now, but, like, by the third date, it would be:
5057	5061	"Hey, baby, I really need to physically express how I feel"...
5061	5063	- ...and all that stuff. - Well, hey, baby...
5063	5067	you know, three dates... Make it 10, 10 dates.
5068	5070	How about 15?
5070	5074	Fifteen. Screw your 15. 20 dates.
5074	5076	- Okay, 20 dates. - Twenty dates.
5076	5079	- Okay. - This is genius.
5079	5080	It's gonna hurt.
5082	5084	Not as much as you think.
5086	5088	We can really get to know each other this way.
5088	5089	Yeah.
5090	5092	- This is one, right? - No, next one.
5098	5100	Is it safe to come in, or are you guys doing it?
5100	5102	Honey, it's safe.
5104	5105	Great.
5105	5107	Well, good timing.
5107	5109	- Yeah. - You remember Marla.
5109	5112	- Hi, we met. - And this is my little bunny rabbit.
5112	5114	- Julia. - Hey.
5114	5116	- This is Andy. - Julia, how you doing?
5117	5121	You know what, do you by any chance like magic?
5121	5124	- Yeah. - I thought that you might.
5124	5125	Because I noticed on the way in...
5125	5128	that you had something shiny behind your ear.
5128	5130	Marla, did you see that? Something behind her ear?
5130	5132	You think you do? Could I check?
5132	5134	Do you mind if I check behind your ear?
5134	5136	Big money!
5137	5140	- That's amazing. - Wow, it is amazing.
5140	5142	There's something else, too, behind your ear, I think.
5142	5145	No, actually it's not behind your ear. I think it is your ear.
5145	5146	Rip!
5146	5149	It is your ear. There is your ear.
5149	5151	I ripped it off.
5151	5152	- Gross! - Yeah, that's...
5152	5156	All right. Wait. Okay, but that means that you...
5156	5159	walk around with a rubber ear in your pocket all day?
5159	5161	Yeah, like half the time.
5161	5163	You know, I can come to your high school...
5163	5165	and do it for your friends if you want.
5165	5167	You know what, I should head out.
5167	5169	- Really? - Yeah.
5169	5171	I have to give you a ride home.
5171	5172	Right. Yes, you do.
5172	5174	Yeah, 'cause you don't have a car or anything, right?
5174	5176	Right, I don't have a car.
5176	5179	'Cause he doesn't have a car, and he does magic.
5179	5180	Awesome.
5180	5183	And sarcasm is like a second language to me.
5183	5185	So, I'm right there with you.
5188	5189	But, Dad...
5190	5193	I don't know how to love.
5194	5196	You never...
5196	5200	taught me how...
5203	5205	- Hello. - Hey, Cal.
5205	5208	- Hey. - I just got back from a date.
5208	5210	Did you tell her you're a virgin?
5210	5212	No. I haven't gotten to that yet.
5212	5215	Really? Are you having sex right now?
5215	5217	No. She was incredible.
5217	5220	She was amazing. She didn't pressure me.
5220	5223	And she has three kids.
5223	5225	And one of her kids has a kid.
5227	5228	You all right?
5229	5233	Did you just say she has three kids, one of whom has a kid?
5233	5235	- Yeah. - So, so, she's a grandma?
5236	5237	No.
5237	5238	I'm not a doctor or anything like that...
5239	5241	but she's a fucking grandma.
5242	5243	Yeah, whatever, you know.
5243	5245	She's the hottest grandma I ever saw.
5245	5246	Yeah, she is. She's a hot grandma.
5246	5249	That's a good-looking grandma. My grandma looks like Jack Palance.
5249	5250	Well, she's no Jack Palance.
5250	5252	No. If Jack Palance looked like that lady...
5252	5254	I would want to fuck Jack Palance right now.
5254	5255	Yeah, me, too.
5256	5257	She's a hot grandma.
5257	5259	Heck, yeah. No, do a grandma, man.
5259	5261	You should fuck her on her plastic-covered couch.
5262	5264	Fuck her while she watches Murder, She Wrote.
5264	5266	She would probably find that very erotic.
5266	5267	Yeah, whatever, you know.
5267	5271	Fuck her and then have her send you a check for $12 on your birthday.
5271	5274	I'm the dude with the hot granny.
5275	5277	What did you want to talk to me about?
5277	5279	Well, Andy, the numbers just came in...
5279	5282	and you are by far our best salesman.
5283	5285	So, I am promoting you to floor manager.
5286	5287	This is the bullshit of all bullshits!
5287	5289	You scumbag! Ass kisser!
5292	5293	Thank you. That's great.
5294	5298	- I understand you have a girlfriend. - Yeah, kind of seeing somebody.
5298	5301	- I'm very happy for you. - Thanks. She's great.
5301	5302	Are you still a virgin?
5303	5305	You know, I don't really...
5305	5307	- ...talk about my personal life. - You're a virgin.
5307	5308	- Yes, I am. - Yeah.
5310	5311	My door is always open.
5312	5314	- So to speak. - Great.
5315	5317	Great. Thank you.
5317	5319	I'm very discreet.
5322	5324	But I'll haunt your dreams.
5326	5328	- Okay. - Okay.
5333	5334	Wow.
5336	5340	- So who's gonna take my job? - Cal will be taking over your job.
5340	5342	And he's interviewing people right now...
5342	5344	for his old job.
5344	5346	So, have you ever worked with electronics before?
5346	5347	- No. - No?
5347	5350	But I have electronics in my home.
5352	5355	Perfect. That's the job pretty much. You're very well-qualified.
5356	5358	More than these other losers.
5359	5362	- I could do that... - Wait, last thing.
5362	5364	I'm also gonna need that extended warranty on it...
5364	5366	for the price of "on the house."
5368	5370	That I can't do.
5370	5372	Hey, don't be a Negro. Be my nigger. All right? Help me out.
5372	5375	Hold up. I ain't nobody's nigger.
5376	5378	I mean, you're somebody's nigger wearing this nigger tie.
5378	5380	Now you being condescending.
5380	5383	See, you've been warned, all right? Just move forward amicably.
5384	5385	Okay. Well, check this out.
5385	5387	First of all, you're throwing too many big words at me.
5387	5389	Okay, now because I don't understand them...
5389	5390	I'm gonna take them as disrespect.
5390	5393	Watch your mouth, and help me with the sale.
5393	5396	Okay, see, now you found yourself a nigger.
5396	5398	You were looking for a nigger? Nigger here now. See?
5399	5402	Today's forecast: Dark and cloudy, and chance of drive-by.
5402	5404	- You want to go? - I suggest you move back.
5404	5406	Then, nig, fire on.
5406	5407	What are we gonna do?
5408	5410	What are you gonna do, Mr. Floor Manager?
5412	5413	Go, get them, tiger.
5413	5415	This shit just got rigged.
5415	5417	- What are you gonna do, bitch? - I'll tell you what.
5417	5419	You know Luca Perry from 20th and 25th?
5419	5421	You ever heard of, Rolling 20s, nigger?
5421	5423	Since I was 16, nigger, I'm saying "frosty."
5423	5425	You know what I'm saying, "spoon", nigger.
5425	5427	We fucked dwarfs in the ass.
5427	5429	Nigger, this dwarf here don't got to be tall...
5429	5430	to pull the trigger off in somebody face!
5430	5433	- Come on nigger, back up. - What's up? Hey...
5433	5434	Welcome to Smart Tech.
5434	5435	- Is this your boy? - What can I help you with?
5436	5437	Yeah, nigger, we will both mash you!
5437	5439	- How can we help you, sir? - Nigger, what?
5439	5441	No, he don't need no help. He's already been served.
5442	5444	I served him. He's taken care of. He's a little slow, but he got it.
5444	5447	See, what he thought was he can come up in here and make the rules.
5447	5450	But now he see that Jay make the moves at Smart Tech...
5450	5453	that I run this, bitch and now he bought the bounce.
5454	5455	This your boy?
5455	5458	Yeah, that's my boy. We represent Smart Tech.
5458	5459	You just got fucked up with him.
5459	5462	Both y'all niggers going get clapped up when I get back.
5463	5464	Both of you all niggers.
5464	5466	- What did I do? - It don't fucking matter!
5467	5470	Yeah, aim high, Willis. Aim high!
5470	5471	Please don't do this.
5472	5474	Jay, what's going on?
5476	5478	Jill broke up with me.
5478	5480	I'm so sorry. What happened?
5481	5483	I came home a little tipsy.
5483	5485	And I had one of my condoms on still.
5487	5491	Woke up the next morning and jumped in the shower with her.
5491	5493	I don't know what I was thinking.
5493	5495	Why did you cheat on her?
5495	5497	Because I'm insecure! You can't tell?
5497	5499	I know, man. It's gonna be okay.
5499	5502	- I'm cold. - It's gonna be all right, man.
5502	5503	Seriously, man, I'm sorry.
5504	5505	I apologize to you. I know.
5505	5507	If you wanna have a meaningful relationship...
5507	5509	you've got to leave the sex out of it, man. You're right.
5510	5511	It's all right. You're good.
5511	5513	I'm sorry. Come here. I love you, man.
5513	5514	Man, I love you, too.
5515	5517	You're a good guy.
5519	5522	Do you know how I know you guys are gay?
5522	5524	You're holding each other ever so gently.
5524	5525	Cabron.
5532	5533	Bravo.
5533	5535	At least he can cook, Mom.
5539	5542	I love... Spiderman.
5555	5557	Pull out slowly and go straight ahead.
5586	5587	I'm all right.
5588	5589	Nobody's there.
5589	5591	I want to know everything about you.
5591	5592	I want to tell you.
5592	5593	- You do? - Yeah.
5593	5596	Like, what do you want to do? What are your dreams?
5597	5600	You don't wanna work at Smart Tech for the rest of your life.
5600	5602	I've been working there for a long time.
5602	5606	And I've been thinking lately that maybe I should open my own store.
5606	5607	- Really? - Yeah.
5608	5611	- What kind of store? - Well, like a stereo store.
5611	5613	Oh, my God, that is... Why don't you do that?
5613	5615	I don't have enough money to do that.
5615	5617	What about those collectibles?
5617	5619	I bet if you sold those, you could make a lot of money.
5619	5623	I just sold a guy's G. I. Joe for $1,000.
5623	5625	- Really? - Do you have any of those?
5625	5626	- Yeah. - You do?
5626	5627	I have 47 of them.
5627	5628	No, you don't.
5628	5630	- Yeah, in their original boxes. - You do?
5630	5633	I could help you sell them on eBay.
5633	5636	I would not take a commission, I swear to God.
5636	5639	You could do it. You could totally pull it off.
5640	5642	- Yeah, let's do it. - Let's do it.
5661	5662	Aquaman.
5662	5663	Here.
5664	5665	Clothes on.
5667	5669	I'll send you off to...
5670	5673	a farm with lots of land.
5673	5676	So, you and other Aquamen can run around...
5677	5679	and play in the Aquafields.
5689	5691	Godspeed, Col. Steve Austin.
5694	5696	You don't wanna go, do you? Okay, you can stay.
5696	5698	Steve Austin can stay.
5702	5704	Hey, Cal. David.
5704	5706	Way to sell a big TV.
5706	5708	She likes you, man.
5708	5710	Too bad I retired my penis.
5710	5713	Mooj, we try to be fair with the schedule but it's hard.
5714	5717	Okay, but why every damn schedule comes up, I get most early shift?
5717	5720	It's bullshit. Nobody buys stereo at 10:00 in the morning.
5720	5721	No, I understand.
5721	5724	People buy stereo between 6:00 and 8:00.
5724	5725	Mmm-hmm.
5725	5729	Rich men get off work, then buy stereo.
5729	5731	- Right. - Not after fucking brunch.
5732	5733	Okay. Here's what we're gonna do.
5733	5736	I'm going to give you a couple of Jay's shifts.
5736	5739	And then I'll give you a couple of mine and that way...
5739	5742	- ...we'll all be equal, okay. - Thank you, Andy.
5742	5743	It's okay.
5744	5745	You're a good man, Andy.
5747	5750	By the way, what date are you on, now?
5751	5753	I think it's around 17.
5753	5756	It's hard to tell what actually constitutes a date, though.
5756	5760	Three to go. So that means you're gonna have sex in three days.
5761	5763	Maybe, I might try to space them out a little bit.
5763	5766	- I'll pray for your cock. - Okay, thanks.
5766	5768	- Thanks. Thank you. - Have a good cocky.
5768	5771	Trish is on the phone. Here is a shock.
5771	5773	- Girlfriend with a problem. - Hello.
5773	5775	I have done everything but sex!
5775	5778	I'm a woman, okay? Deal with it!
5778	5780	I'm gonna start taking you back to church.
5780	5782	We are gonna start going to church.
5782	5784	- Hello? - You know what?
5784	5785	What the hell are you talking about?
5785	5788	Oh, my God, I cannot believe this. Thank God you're here.
5788	5791	Jesus Christ. Marla locked herself in the bathroom.
5791	5792	What happened?
5792	5794	She wants to go to the family health clinic.
5794	5796	She wants birth control. But she's too young.
5796	5799	I want to have sex with my boyfriend! But I can't, Mom!
5799	5800	So, you want me to take her?
5801	5803	- No, I don't want you to take her. - Okay, all right.
5803	5806	I want her to keep it in her pants until she gets to college.
5806	5807	Whoa, whoa, whoa!
5807	5808	"Keep it in my pants"?
5808	5811	Okay, you didn't keep it in your pants, Mom.
5811	5814	I know. I don't want you to make the same mistakes as me, Marla.
5814	5817	Mistakes? Okay, so I was a mistake then.
5817	5821	No, you're not a mistake. Your sister was the mistake.
5822	5824	Oh, my God!
5824	5827	Her older sister, I mean, she wasn't planned, you know what I mean?
5827	5829	Because I was such a... Oh, God, you wanna run away, don't you?
5829	5831	No.
5831	5833	You and your boyfriend have sex all the time!
5833	5835	Oh, my God! Are you kidding?
5835	5837	We never have sex. Do we ever have sex?
5837	5839	No, we don't.
5839	5841	What? Yes, you do!
5841	5843	You're such a liar! Why do you lie to me?
5843	5844	Why?
5848	5850	I didn't hear anything after "a liar."
5850	5853	- What did she say after "a liar"? - She sounds like a tea kettle.
5853	5855	Fuck you!
5857	5860	- Maybe I should take her. - No, I don't think so.
5860	5862	You know, a little information never hurt anybody.
5876	5877	Cool.
5878	5879	Wow!
5882	5884	Where do you put the penis?
5885	5886	Oh, shit.
5897	5898	It is...
5899	5901	not a Rubik's Cube.
5903	5904	Shit.
5906	5908	God, how much longer are they gonna make us wait?
5908	5911	I don't know. They should be out in a second.
5911	5912	Now, you're all here...
5912	5915	because you're interested in obtaining birth control.
5915	5916	Any questions?
5917	5919	Here's a cute story. I came home the other day...
5919	5922	and he is with his girlfriend in my marital bed...
5922	5925	doing things that are illegal in Alabama.
5925	5929	Sex acts, right? Things that my wife won't do, okay?
5929	5932	- Did you have a question? - How do I get my wife to do that?
5932	5933	Does anybody else have a question?
5933	5937	My daughter is, for lack of a better word...
5937	5938	dumb.
5939	5941	How do I stop her menstrual cycle?
5941	5943	You want her to stop having a menstrual cycle?
5943	5946	I want to stop it, maybe just for a few years.
5946	5948	Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.
5948	5951	- Does anybody else have a question? - I have a question.
5951	5955	I think some of the people here might be sexually inexperienced.
5956	5959	Is it true that if you don't use it, you lose it?
5959	5961	Is that a serious question?
5961	5963	- No. It wasn't. - Okay.
5963	5967	Now, there are a lot of activities that you can engage in...
5967	5970	without having sex that are both fun and safe.
5970	5972	What sort of activities? I think...
5972	5974	everybody wants to know about the activities.
5974	5979	Well, instead of having intercourse, you could have outer-course.
5979	5981	Outer-course? What's that?
5982	5983	Yeah, what is that?
5983	5987	Outer-course is anything that isn't vaginal intercourse.
5987	5989	I prefer vaginal intercourse.
5991	5992	He really does.
5993	5996	Now, there are ways of having sex without intercourse.
5997	6001	Let's see, there are things like body rubbing or dry humping.
6001	6002	You could dry hump.
6002	6005	- There is masturbation. - Masturbation. Play with yourself.
6005	6007	- Mutual masturbation. - Play with a friend.
6008	6011	Deep kissing. There is erotic massage.
6011	6013	That sounds like it would be nice.
6013	6016	- Oral sex play. - Sounds like my Friday night.
6016	6018	Shut up, Seth. We went to temple.
6018	6020	Okay, are there any virgins here...
6020	6022	who are thinking about having sex for the first time?
6024	6025	Oh.
6025	6027	Wait. So you're a virgin?
6030	6033	- I'd tap that. - Oh, yeah, you'd "tap that"?
6033	6036	Seth, what, you think you're cool with your little Jew fro?
6036	6039	We don't say, "tap that." What are you talking about, Seth?
6039	6041	You know what, I'm a virgin, too.
6043	6045	That's...
6045	6046	- We're virgins, too. - Yeah.
6048	6051	No, you know what, it's a personal choice...
6051	6053	and I don't think it's weird at all.
6053	6054	You know what your problem is?
6054	6056	You're putting the pussy on a pedestal.
6056	6058	That's the second time I've heard that.
6058	6060	What is the "pussy on a pedestal" thing?
6060	6064	Okay, I can't listen to anymore of this, 'cause it's making me sick.
6064	6065	So, bye.
6065	6067	You can get this information on your website, right?
6067	6069	- Yes. - Thanks. Nice meeting everybody.
6069	6070	Any other questions?
6070	6072	Do you have any extra-large condoms?
6072	6074	Seth, you got a tiny penis.
6078	6081	So, I made that all up to help you out.
6083	6085	No, you didn't.
6085	6088	But thank you for doing that.
6091	6093	How can you tell?
6093	6096	Well, you know, I go to school with, like, 400 guys...
6096	6097	who are all trying to have sex.
6097	6099	And, yeah, so I can tell who's done it.
6099	6100	Of course.
6100	6103	- And you really haven't? - No, I really haven't.
6104	6106	Please don't tell your mom, okay?
6106	6108	- Yeah, I won't. - Thanks.
6108	6111	But when are you gonna tell her?
6111	6113	Believe me, I'm working on it.
6115	6116	I am working on it.
6119	6121	Do you have any weed?
6123	6124	- Yeah. - You do have some.
6124	6126	Can spare any or is it all spoken for?
6127	6129	I mean, like what are we talking? Are we...
6129	6131	Just enough to get me baked for like a week.
6132	6133	That's a lot of weed.
6133	6135	Yeah, I am taking vacation next week, so...
6135	6137	- Where are you going? - I'm not going anywhere.
6137	6138	- I'll stay in my apartment. - Just getting baked?
6139	6140	I want to be baked the whole time.
6140	6142	Watch TV, I'll probably re-watch Gandhi.
6143	6145	- Gandhi baked is good. - Yes, isn't it?
6145	6147	I always feel bad when I watch it baked...
6147	6149	'cause I get really hungry and I'm eating a lot...
6149	6150	and poor Gandhi is...
6150	6152	- ...fucking starving his ass off. - Starving, I know.
6155	6157	- Sounds good. - Yeah.
6157	6160	I'm going to take her to capacity. Are you okay with that?
6160	6161	Give it a shot.
6161	6163	Freak! Oh, yeah!
6165	6167	Michael McDonald, man, I haven't heard this in years.
6168	6170	Yeah, I haven't heard it in like 48 minutes.
6170	6173	If I get the set, will you throw in the DVD?
6173	6175	You don't get the set. I'll throw in the DVD.
6176	6177	I'll take it.
6177	6179	- Really? - Yeah.
6180	6182	Y'all want to see something beautiful? Come here.
6182	6185	You want to see the most beautiful thing in the world? Check this out.
6185	6189	This is my baby right here. That's my baby's dick right there.
6190	6192	Looks like a poltergeist.
6192	6193	That is his foot.
6193	6196	Look at his dick. That's not even four months.
6196	6197	Extrapolate that.
6197	6199	By the time he's 30, what's gonna happen?
6199	6202	Yo, Andy! Come check this out, dawg.
6202	6204	Is this the movie about babies that are geniuses?
6204	6207	No, this is my child, dude. Jill is pregnant.
6207	6208	- That's yours? - Yeah.
6208	6210	That's why she broke up with me in the first place...
6210	6213	'cause she just thought that I wouldn't be a good father...
6213	6215	in light of the fact that I'd be cheating on her all the time.
6215	6217	But she got over all that. It's cool now.
6217	6219	Congratulations, man. That is great.
6219	6221	We having a party tonight, Andy...
6221	6222	and I really want you to be there, man.
6222	6225	We celebrating and I really, really want you to be there.
6225	6227	It looks like the Doppler radar.
6227	6228	Can you believe that?
6229	6230	This child ain't even four months old.
6230	6233	He ain't four months old yet. Look at what he's packing.
6233	6235	Everybody dick looks big on 60-inch TV.
6235	6238	My sister's dick looks big on TV, okay?
6239	6241	Oh, my God, this guy, Eric Gilliland...
6242	6244	- ...he has bought, like, 15 of these. - Really?
6245	6248	Yeah, I think he likes action figures even more than you.
6248	6250	- That is impossible. - I think so.
6251	6254	Andy, the way these things are flying off your shelf...
6254	6257	you know, I think you could actually make like...
6258	6259	maybe like $100,000.
6259	6262	- Really? - Yeah, you could open your store.
6262	6263	- Wow. - Honey...
6263	6265	- That's a lot of money. - I know.
6265	6268	That's incredible. I wouldn't have done it without you.
6268	6269	Thanks.
6270	6273	- And that's not the only good news. - What?
6273	6276	- You know what tonight is? - Survivor is on?
6278	6279	- No. - I know.
6280	6282	Is it The Apprentice?
6283	6284	No.
6285	6286	What?
6289	6293	It's our 20th date.
6300	6301	- Wow. - Yeah.
6301	6302	- Really? - Uh-huh.
6303	6306	Seriously? I think we're at 18.
6306	6308	'Cause there were a couple of dates there...
6308	6310	- ...that don't really count as dates. - No.
6310	6312	I'll give you a free pass on those other ones.
6313	6315	Thank you.
6315	6316	- Listen. - What?
6316	6317	- Listen. - Mmm-hmm.
6319	6320	I really like you.
6326	6328	I think I'm falling for you.
6329	6333	I don't know. I kind of see this going somewhere.
6333	6334	I do, too.
6334	6337	I just think we should just go crazy on each other.
6339	6341	- Okay. - Okay?
6342	6343	Oh, thank God!
6346	6347	Oh!
6347	6350	Okay, I should... I gotta pick those up.
6350	6351	Don't pick them up now.
6351	6352	No, I have to pick those up right now.
6352	6354	- Wait, we'll get them later. - Listen, no, I can't, no.
6355	6356	Listen, it's really important because...
6356	6358	once the integrity of the box gets compromised...
6359	6361	This is original packaging and that's why these things...
6361	6363	are so valuable. So you don't screw with that.
6363	6365	- You really don't screw with that. - All right.
6365	6367	We can wrap them again later, you know.
6367	6369	Yeah, I know. But you know what...
6369	6371	this is very important that we don't lose the value...
6371	6372	and compromise the integrity of it.
6372	6375	Andy, I'm throwing myself at you and...
6375	6377	all you can think about is a fucking toy.
6377	6380	They're not fucking toys! This is Iron Man, okay?
6380	6382	I got this when I was in second grade.
6383	6385	Do you know how hard it is for a kid to not open that?
6385	6387	This is important.
6387	6388	These are my things...
6388	6391	and you are trying to make me sell them and I don't want to.
6391	6393	- No. - And you're making me.
6393	6395	- I'm not making... - You are encouraging me...
6395	6397	- ...to quit my job. - I'm not! I'm not trying to...
6397	6400	You want me to open a store. You want me to sell everything.
6400	6402	You know what, I'm gonna tell you something.
6402	6405	I don't just change like that. I can't just change for you.
6405	6408	I don't... I'm not trying to change you. I like you.
6408	6410	I'm just... I'm trying to help you grow up, Andy.
6410	6412	Well, thanks a lot.
6412	6416	I mean, my God, you ride a bicycle to work in a stockroom.
6416	6418	You know what, I'm not in the stockroom anymore.
6418	6420	- I'm a floor manager. - Okay.
6420	6423	And I ride a bike because I like to. Einstein rode a bike.
6423	6426	He had a wife who he fucked, by the way.
6427	6429	What do I have to do for you to have sex with me?
6429	6431	Do you want me to dress up like Thor? I'll dress up like Thor.
6431	6433	I'll dress up like Iron Man.
6433	6435	What do they do? I'll do it.
6435	6437	What? Everything's always about sex.
6437	6438	Why don't you want to have sex with me?
6439	6441	Why not? Tell me. You tell me the truth.
6441	6443	Is it because I have a kid who has a kid? Is that why?
6443	6445	No, it's cool that you're a grandmother.
6445	6447	I love the fact that you're a grandmother.
6447	6449	- Oh, God! - You are. You're a hot grandma.
6449	6450	Oh, my God!
6451	6453	You are so mean! Get out!
6453	6455	- Okay, fine. Good! - Good, fine. You're gonna go.
6455	6459	- I didn't ask for any of this. - You asked for all of it, Andy.
6459	6461	Okay. Great.
6464	6465	Okay.
6465	6467	That's the way you want it...
6467	6470	that's the way homie's gonna play it.
6471	6472	Yeah. Truth be told.
6490	6492	Baby, you better enjoy yourself tonight...
6492	6494	'cause once this baby's born, you ain't going out again...
6495	6496	till that baby is in college.
6496	6497	- Me? - Yeah.
6497	6499	You the club rat. I'm not the one that be going out.
6499	6501	I'm not a club rat.
6501	6504	You're gonna get up, you march over there...
6504	6507	and I want you to hit on Bernadette now.
6507	6509	Dude, I'm not gonna hit on Bernadette.
6509	6510	Yes, you are, man...
6510	6513	'cause your depression is boring me for one thing...
6513	6515	and it's actually making me a little depressed...
6515	6517	which is then in turn making me more depressed...
6517	6519	that you're actually affecting my mood.
6519	6522	Look, I'm not in any kind of place to talk to a woman, all right?
6522	6524	I'm just... I'm fragile.
6524	6526	I hired her for you.
6526	6530	I hired a 90-pound girl to work in the stockroom at Smart Tech...
6530	6532	for you, okay?
6532	6533	I should have hired a 300-pound guy...
6533	6535	who could lift a 60-inch flat screen.
6535	6537	But instead I hired a hot girl...
6537	6541	who can't lift an iPod to bring you out of your funk.
6542	6543	- You hired her for me? - Yes.
6543	6545	So will you go talk to her?
6545	6547	Yeah, I'm meeting somebody.
6547	6548	No.
6551	6554	- Did you just flick me in the nuts? - No.
6554	6557	Flicked you in the fleshy patch where your nuts used to be.
6558	6560	Quit flicking my balls, man.
6560	6562	Okay, I'll stop flicking your balls.
6562	6565	But I'll start punching your nuts.
6566	6567	Oh!
6567	6568	Okay.
6572	6574	Well played, sir.
6574	6575	- Okay. - Thank you.
6575	6577	No problem, man. Go get 'em.
6578	6580	Mooj, you done see my son...
6580	6581	you know his foot gonna be bigger than this.
6582	6585	If that baby looks Pakistani, don't fucking look at me, okay?
6585	6588	I wouldn't mind. You got good genes. How old are you? What, 138?
6588	6591	When your son is born, is he already in parole?
6600	6603	I need some poon.
6603	6606	You guys were so right, right from the beginning.
6607	6611	I need genital to genital connection and that's all I need.
6612	6615	You know, the thing about relationships is that they...
6616	6617	make one person go...
6619	6621	And the other person go, "What are you talking about?"
6621	6622	And then one person goes...
6624	6626	How much have you had to drink, man?
6626	6629	How much have I had to drink? How many pots have you smoken?
6629	6630	What are you talking about?
6631	6634	How many times have you gone to the bathroom in your life?
6634	6635	Let me ask you that.
6635	6638	You know what, you don't have an answer for that, do you?
6638	6640	Fuck you, man! I'm sorry.
6640	6643	No, you're such a good guy, and I appreciate you.
6643	6645	What's up, baby, I didn't know you had came already.
6645	6647	Hey, motherfucker!
6650	6652	Man, you know what, tonight is the night.
6652	6657	You know what, you were totally right and I was wrong.
6657	6661	You were right all along. You cannot have a relationship...
6662	6664	with somebody until...
6664	6667	you have sex and that's the long...
6667	6669	That's the long and short of it.
6669	6672	- So, thank you. - That's good.
6672	6675	And now I have to go hunt for some hos.
6678	6682	- He going to be all right? - No, I don't think he is.
6682	6684	- Cal's a good guy. - Yeah, he's a great guy.
6684	6686	It's so funny, because, you know...
6686	6689	when I first met him and I thought you were cute at the store...
6689	6692	- ...he told me you were gay. - I'm not gay.
6692	6695	Cal says that I'm gay because he has a real problem...
6695	6697	with his own gayness.
6697	6701	But seriously, I'm going to lay it out for you, right now.
6701	6704	I was a little reticent to come over and talk to you.
6704	6707	You're very pretty and you seem very nice. The truth is...
6707	6710	I dated this woman, let me rephrase that, I dated this whore...
6711	6712	who stomped all over my heart.
6712	6715	And it's just taking me a little while to kind of...
6715	6717	you know, get back in the game.
6717	6719	Oh, my God. Say no more.
6719	6721	My last boyfriend Sal junior, is a scum bag.
6721	6723	I would totally pay people to have him killed.
6724	6726	That's how much I fucking hate that damn scum bag.
6726	6728	- God, you're fucking awesome. - You too.
6730	6732	Hey, you!
6734	6735	- Hey. - Hey.
6736	6737	How you doing?
6738	6740	Much better, now that I'm talking to you.
6741	6743	Hey, lookie, I can see through your shirt.
6744	6745	Nice.
6746	6749	So, you think we should...
6749	6752	take this party to my apartment or what?
6752	6756	I am RSVPing "yes."
6759	6762	Hope you have a big trunk because I'm putting my bike in it.
6765	6767	Yeah, let's go!
6772	6774	Mom, I left my phone somewhere and I...
6775	6776	Thank you.
6778	6781	What's the matter? Where is Andy?
6781	6784	- We had a big fight, just... - Oh, Mom.
6785	6787	He just stormed out of here.
6787	6788	What happened?
6788	6791	Well, I just... Wait a minute, I thought you hated him.
6791	6794	I don't hate him. I mean, he does do magic, but...
6794	6797	you know, he's a big dork...
6797	6799	and I like seeing you happy.
6801	6802	I do.
6804	6807	- That's sweet, that's really sweet. - Mom.
6807	6810	Why don't you just go talk to him, work it out.
6810	6813	'Cause if the thing is that important, you can't just stop.
6814	6816	Let me dance for you. I would love it.
6817	6821	Look at your bra and your breasts and everything. That's so great.
6822	6826	Wow! You know what? You're so hot. You're so hot.
6826	6828	I'm smoking hot.
6828	6831	You know what? I'm just going to have sex with you.
6831	6833	Yes! Let's have sex.
6833	6835	- It's going to happen. - That's why we are here.
6835	6837	That's totally what's going to happen.
6838	6840	We could do it in the...
6841	6843	Butt, if you want to.
6844	6846	But, if I want to what?
6847	6850	- Butt. - But what? What?
6850	6852	- Do it. - Do it?
6852	6853	What?
6853	6856	I don't know what you're talking about.
6856	6858	- Butt. - But...
6859	6860	- What? - ...what?
6863	6865	But, it still feels so right.
6878	6879	Yeah!
6882	6886	Yeah. Right! Okay. Yeah.
6887	6889	That was a fun day.
6890	6893	You are so kinky.
6894	6896	Yeah, I'm so kinky.
6896	6900	That's why I did this because I thought it looks...
6900	6902	You like to shave, don't you?
6902	6905	- Let's shave each other. - I don't think you have any hair.
6905	6907	You know where to shave me.
6907	6909	- Yeah. - Because I want to shave you.
6909	6911	I want to shave your head.
6912	6914	I wanna give you a buzz cut.
6915	6917	Let's get in the bath.
6917	6919	In the bath?
6919	6923	Yes. We're gonna get dirty. Dirty, dirty. Sudsy.
6923	6925	It's just about time I got really dirty.
6925	6926	Yeah.
6929	6934	Hey. Hi, it's me, and I'm on my way to your house.
6934	6936	I want to do whatever you want to do, okay?
6936	6940	Fifty dates. 100. I hope not, but whatever.
6941	6944	I'm gonna see you soon, okay? Bye.
6948	6951	Wow. Okay, well, that was fast. Okay.
6953	6956	Wow! Holy shit!
6956	6959	Wow. This is just the right thing to happen.
6959	6963	Yeah, yeah, yeah! Wow! Almost got my penis.
6963	6964	Come to mama.
6966	6969	I'm gonna really take care of you tonight.
6969	6971	You're never gonna forget Beth.
6982	6984	I just want to please you.
6984	6986	What do you like?
6987	6990	I don't know. What do you like?
6990	6993	Can I show you what I like?
6993	6994	Okay.
7008	7011	It's so hot in here.
7011	7014	I wanna introduce you to my friend.
7018	7020	Your friend is so shiny.
7021	7024	This guy knows exactly what I like.
7029	7031	Where's you friend going?
7033	7036	This is how I'm gonna warm up for you.
7037	7041	That's always good to warm up. You don't wanna pull something.
7058	7061	Wow, this is graphic.
7075	7076	I can't do it.
7078	7080	God, what are you doing here?
7080	7083	We came here because we were concerned about you and Trish...
7083	7085	and now I could not give a fuck.
7085	7088	How did you even know where she lives?
7088	7090	- I hit it like eight months back. - What?
7091	7093	Never gave her back the key, man. You have no idea...
7093	7095	where this is going, all right? That girl is a freak.
7095	7099	Oh, it's happening! It's happening! Andy!
7099	7101	You think?
7101	7103	We've been talking, and look...
7104	7106	if you love Trish, you can't do this.
7106	7109	Look, you guys, I don't know what I'm doing anymore.
7109	7112	I don't even know who I am. All I know is...
7112	7115	that woman scares the shit out of me...
7115	7118	and I just wanna go home, okay?
7118	7120	- Let's go. - We should all get out of here.
7120	7122	- Okay. - We should all go.
7122	7123	It wasn't that good for me.
7123	7125	We should totally get out of here.
7125	7128	We should run away from here.
7134	7135	Hey.
7137	7138	Cal.
7140	7142	Go around!
7143	7145	Come on, just go around me!
7148	7150	Can't you hear me?
7158	7161	Hey, there. Hi, Trish.
7162	7165	Man, I'm really sorry about tonight.
7165	7166	What's this?
7167	7169	Those are David's.
7171	7173	I think he has a problem.
7173	7175	- These are David's? - He's into that.
7176	7179	David's Boner Jams '03?
7180	7182	Yeah, it's so sad.
7182	7185	He compiled all the best boner scenes, I guess.
7186	7188	This isn't what it looks like, okay?
7189	7192	- What does this look like? - A vagina.
7193	7195	And what do you do with this vagina?
7195	7198	To learn. It's for medicinal purposes.
7198	7199	Ugh.
7199	7201	- Hey, I'm sorry. God... - What's this?
7202	7205	This your date drug? Your roofie?
7205	7207	It's a Mentos.
7207	7209	They're "The Freshmaker."
7209	7211	Yeah, right.
7211	7213	What are you, some kind of sex pervert?
7213	7214	Are you a deviant or something?
7214	7217	- No, I'm not a sexual deviant! - What is all this?
7217	7220	I haven't even tried to have sex with you, so...
7220	7223	What are you trying to do? What are you buttering me up for?
7223	7224	Come on.
7224	7226	You're not gonna try and kill me, are you?
7226	7228	- Look, Trish. - You didn't get a new carpet.
7229	7232	I'm not trying to kill you. I love you.
7232	7235	- I love you. - Oh, God!
7235	7236	Trish.
7245	7247	Trish. No!
7248	7250	No. Trish, stop.
7255	7256	Come on, Trish!
7260	7262	I need to talk to you!
7262	7263	No!
7265	7266	Damn it.
7298	7299	Oh, my God!
7302	7305	Andy! Oh, my God!
7305	7306	Call 911.
7307	7309	Oh, my... Andy.
7309	7311	Oh, my God!
7311	7314	I'm gonna need a minute. I'm in a lot of pain right now.
7314	7316	Oh, my God. Are you okay?
7316	7317	Not bad.
7317	7319	There were two sides to that billboard.
7319	7321	And they both hurt equally.
7322	7324	Andy. Andy.
7326	7329	- Are you okay? - I'm okay.
7329	7331	No, I'm not okay.
7332	7333	I'm a virgin.
7336	7337	A what?
7338	7340	I'm a virgin. I always have been.
7341	7345	Andy, is that what all this was about?
7346	7347	I'm sorry.
7347	7349	You're just a virgin, that's all?
7350	7352	- Yeah. - That's good. That's a good thing.
7354	7356	I feel stupid.
7358	7360	It's okay. I thought you were trying to kill me.
7362	7363	No.
7364	7365	Oh, my God.
7366	7369	No, I'm not trying to kill you.
7373	7375	That's why I never tried to have sex with you.
7376	7378	I was scared, okay? I just...
7379	7381	'Cause I didn't know what I was doing.
7381	7383	I just didn't think it would be good.
7383	7386	Of course it'll be good. We love each other.
7387	7389	Really?
7390	7392	I love you.
7393	7394	Yeah.
7399	7401	Get the fuck out of the road, virgin!
7403	7405	Shut up, you fucking jerk!
7405	7408	No, that's okay. That's all right. Sorry.
7409	7410	You know what...
7411	7413	for so long I thought that there was something wrong with me...
7413	7416	because it had never happened, but...
7419	7423	I realize now that it was just because I was waiting for you.
7448	7450	This was some wedding. How could they afford it?
7450	7454	Dude sells his toys and makes like a half a million dollars.
7454	7456	- It's crazy, right? - That's fucking crazy.
7456	7458	We're gonna get some fucking toys.
7458	7460	We are all so happy for you.
7460	7463	I am delighted to say these words.
