253	255	All right, Charlie.
255	259	- That the joint? Who runs it? - l already told you.
259	262	- Refresh my memory. - Spats Colombo.
262	265	- What's the password? - ''I've come to Grandma's funeral.''
265	267	- Your admission card. - Thanks, Charlie.
267	271	lf you want a ringside table, just say you're a pallbearer.
271	273	We're all set. Whens the kickoff?
273	276	I'd better blow. lf Colombo sees me, it's goodbye, Charlie.
277	279	Goodbye, Charlie.
280	283	Give me five minutes, then hit 'em with everything you got.
283	285	You betcha.
300	302	Good evening, sir.
302	306	- I'm Mr Mozarella. What can l do for you? - I've come to the old lady's funeral.
306	308	l haven't seen you at our services before.
308	311	- No, I've been on the wagon. - Please.
311	313	Where is the wake? I'm one of the pallbearers.
313	316	Show the gentleman into the chapel. Pew number three.
317	319	Yes, Mr Mozarella. This way, sir.
337	340	Well, if you gotta go, that's the way to do it.
340	342	Follow me, please.
354	356	- What'll it be, sir? - Booze.
357	359	- Sorry. We only serve coffee. - Coffee?
359	362	Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour mash coffee...
362	365	Scotch. Make it a demitasse, with soda on the side.
365	369	Wait a minute. Haven't you got a pew not so close to the band?
369	371	How about that one over there?
371	375	Sorry, but that's reserved for members of the immediate family.
385	386	Oops.
392	395	Hey, l want another cup of coffee.
395	398	l want another cup of coffee.
409	411	Better bring a check in case the joint is raided.
412	416	- Who's gonna raid a funeral? - Some people don't respect the dead.
439	442	Say, Joe. Tonight's the night, isn't it?
442	446	- I'll say. - No, tonight we get paid.
446	449	- Why? - I've got to see a dentist tomorrow.
449	452	You wanna blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
453	456	Just a filling. Doesn't have to be gold.
456	461	How can you be so selfish? We owe rent. We owe $89 to Moe's Delicatessen.
461	465	The Chinese laundry is suing us. We owe money to every girl in the line.
465	470	You're right. Tomorrow we'll pay everyone something on account.
470	475	No. Tomorrow we go to the dog track and bet it all on Greased Lightning.
475	478	- You'd bet my money on a dog? - He's a shoo-in.
478	481	Max the waiter knows the electrician that wires the rabbit.
481	485	- What are you givin' me with a rabbit? - The odds are 10 to 1 .
485	489	- Suppose he loses. - Why worry? This job'll last a long time.
489	493	- Suppose it doesn't. - Jerry boy, why paint everyzhing black?
493	498	Suppose you got hit by a truck. Suppose the stock market crashes.
498	501	Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks.
501	504	Suppose the Dodgers leave Brooklyn.
504	506	Suppose Lake Michigan overflows.
506	510	Well, don't look now, but the whole town is underwater.
523	524	Four,
524	525	three,
525	527	two,
527	528	one.
541	545	All right, everybody. This is a raid.
545	548	I'm a federal agent. You're all under arrest.
548	551	l want another cup of coffee.
563	565	All right, Spats.
565	568	- The services are over. Let's go. - Go where?
568	572	A country club for retired bootleggers. I'm puttin' you up for membership.
572	575	- l don't join nothin'. - Oh, you'll like it there.
575	580	I'll get the prison tailor to fit you with a pair of special spats - striped.
580	583	Big joke. What's the rap this time?
583	587	Embalming people with coffee. 86 proof.
587	589	Me? I'm just a customer.
590	595	Oh, come on, Spats. We know you own the joint. Mozarella's just frontin' for you.
595	599	- Mozarella? Never heard of him. - We got different information.
600	602	From who? Toothpick Charlie maybe?
603	605	Toothpick Charlie? Never heard of him.
608	610	Buttermilk.
611	613	Too smart to drink your own stuff, huh?
613	616	Come on. On your feet.
616	620	- You're wastin' the taxpayers' money. - Call your lawyer if you wanna.
620	623	These are my lawyers. All Harvard men.
632	635	l wan' another cuppa coffee.
673	676	That solves one problem. Now we don't have to worry about who to pay first.
677	679	- Quiet. I'm thinking. - The landlady will lock us out.
680	682	At Moe's Deli no more knockwurst on credit.
682	686	We can't borrow from the girls - they're on the way to jail.
686	689	l wonder how much Sam the bookie will give us for our overcoats.
689	694	Sam the bookie? Nothin' doin'. You're not puttin' my overcoat on a dog.
694	697	- Jerry, l told you, it's a sure thing. - We will freeze.
697	700	lt is below zero. We'll get pneumonia.
700	704	Look, stupid, he's 10-1 . Tomorrow we'll have 20 overcoats.
714	716	Greased Lightning.
716	720	- l oughta have my head examined. - l thought you weren't talkin' to me.
720	723	The bull fiddle's dressed warmer than l am.
730	732	- Anyzhing today? - Nothing.
732	733	Thank you.
736	738	- Anyzhing today? - Nothing.
738	740	Thank you.
740	744	l can't go on, Joe. I'm weak from hunger, l got a fever, l got a hole in my shoe...
744	747	lf you gave me a chance, we could be living like kings.
747	749	- How? - There's a dog running in the third.
749	754	Galloping Ghost. He's 1 5-1 and it's his kind of a track. He's a real mudder.
754	757	What do you want from me? My head on a plate?
757	760	No, your bass. lf we hock that and my sax...
760	763	Are you crazy? We're up the creek and you wanna hock the paddle.
764	767	All right, go ahead and starve. What do l care? Freeze.
767	769	- Anyzhing today? - Oh, it's you.
770	772	Well, you've got a lot of nerve.
772	774	Thank you.
774	776	Joe. Come back here.
780	783	Nellie, baby, if it's about Saturday night, l can explain.
784	787	What a heel. l spend $4 to get my hair marcelled,
787	789	l buy me a brand-new negligee,
789	791	l bake him a great big pizza pie.
791	794	- And where were you? - Where were you?
795	796	- With you. - Me?
796	798	Remember? You had this bad tooth.
798	800	lt was impacted. His jaw was swoll out.
800	801	lt was?
802	804	Oh, yeah.
804	807	- l took him for a blood transfusion. - We have the same type blood.
807	810	- Type O. - Oh?
810	814	- I'll make it up to you. - You're makin' it up pretty good so far.
814	819	As soon as we get a job, I'll take you to the swellest restaurant in town.
819	823	How about it? Has Poliakoff got anyzhing for us? We're desperate.
823	827	Well, it just so happens he is looking for a bass.
827	829	And a sax.

830	832	Right.
832	835	- What's the job? - Three weeks in Florida.
835	839	At the Seminole-Ritz in Miami. Transportation and expenses all paid.

877	879	Those idiot broads.
879	883	Here we are, packed and ready to leave for Miami, and what happens?
883	888	The sax runs off with a Bible salesman and the bass gets pregnant.
888	890	Bienstock, l oughta fire you.
890	894	Me? I'm the manager, not the night watchman.
894	896	Hello. Let me talk to Bessie Malone.
897	899	What's she doing in Philadelphia?
899	902	On the level?
902	905	Bessie let her hair grow and is playing with Stokowski.
905	908	- Black Bottom Bessie? - Schpielt zich mit der Philharmonic.
909	910	How about Rosemary Schultz?

913	917	We might as well do the same if we don't find two dames by tonight.
917	921	We don't care where you find them. Just get them on that train by 8 o'clock.
921	925	The moment anyzhing turns up, I'll give you a tinkle.
925	928	Bye, Sig. l wonder if I've got room for another ulcer.
928	931	Nellie, get me long-distance.
931	935	- Sig, we wanna talk to you. - About the Florida job.

938	940	What are ya? Comedians? Get out.

943	947	- You need a bass and a sax? - The instruments are right but you're not.
947	948	I wanna speak to Mr Morris.
949	951	- What's wrong with us? - You're the wrong shape.
951	955	- What do you want? Hunchbacks? - It's not the backs that worry me.
956	957	What kind of a band is it?
957	959	- You gotta be under 25. - We could pass for that.
960	961	- And blond. - We could dye our hair.
961	963	And you gotta be girls.
963	964	No, we couldn't.
964	967	- Mr William Morris. - You mean this is a girls' band?
967	971	Yeah. Good old Nellie. l could wring her neck.
971	973	Let's talk this over. Why couldn't we do it?
974	977	When we worked in the gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.
977	980	When you booked us with the Hawaiian band, we wore grass skirts.
980	983	- What's with him? He drinks? - No, he ain't eatin' so good.
984	986	His empty stomach has gone to his head.
986	990	Joe, three weeks in Florida. We could borrow clothes from the chorus girls.
990	993	- You've flipped your wig. - Now you're talking.
993	996	We get second-hand wigs, a little padding.
996	999	We call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine.

1026	1028	A sax player and a bass?
1028	1033	- lf William Morris doesn't come through... - Come on, Geraldine.
1034	1037	It's 100 miles. It's snowin' outside. How do we get there?

1042	1045	- How'd it go, girls? - I oughta wring your neck.

1051	1055	- Tonight? Why? - Cos I've got some plans.
1055	1059	- I'm not doing anything. - Really?

1207	1211	- Spats, what are you doin' here? - l just dropped in to pay my respects.
1212	1214	- You don't owe me nothin'. - l wouldn't say that.
1214	1217	You recommended my mortuary to your friends.
1217	1220	- l don't know what you mean. - Now l got all those coffins on my hands.
1220	1224	- l hate to see 'em go to waste. - l had nothin' to do with it.

1279	1282	- Come on, Jerry. - Wait a minute.
1282	1286	- Where do you think you're goin'? - Urbana. It's about 100 miles from here...

1294	1297	- We won't breathe a word. - You won't breathe nothin'.
1297	1299	Not even air.
1332	1337	All right, boys, let's blow out of here. We'll take care of those guys later.
1350	1352	l think they got me.
1353	1355	- They got the bull fiddle. - No blood?
1355	1358	lf they catch us, there'll be blood all over. Type O. Come on.
1372	1374	- Where are you running? - As far away as possible.
1374	1379	It's not far enough. Those guys know us. Every hood in Chicago will be after us.
1392	1395	Quick, gimme a nickel.
1398	1399	You're gonna call the police?
1399	1403	We'd never live to testify against Spats Colombo.
1403	1406	We gotta get out of town. We could grow beards.
1406	1408	We will get out of town, but we're gonna shave.
1408	1412	At a time like this? They wanna blast our heads off, and you wanna shave.
1412	1415	- Shave our legs, stupid. - Shave our legs...?
1417	1419	Hello. Mr Poliakoff?
1419	1423	l understand you're looking for a couple of girl musicians.
1440	1444	Florida Limited leaving on track one for Washington,
1444	1447	Charleston, Savannah, Jacksonville and Miami.
1447	1450	All aboard.
1458	1459	What now?
1459	1462	How do they keep their balance in these things?
1462	1466	Must be the way the weight is distributed. Now come on.
1466	1469	lt is so draughty.
1469	1471	They must catch cold all the time.
1471	1474	- Quit stalling. We'll miss the train. - l feel naked.
1474	1478	- l feel like everybody's starin' at me. - With those legs? Are you crazy?
1488	1491	It's no use. We're not gonna get away with it, Joe.
1491	1495	My name is Josephine, and this was your idea in the first place.
1518	1521	Look at that. Look how she moves.
1521	1524	That's just like Jell-O on springs.
1524	1527	They must have some sort of built-in motor or something.
1527	1530	l tell ya, it's a whole different sex.
1530	1532	Nobody's asking you to have a baby.
1532	1536	As soon as we're in Florida we'll blow this whole setup.
1536	1538	You will not talk me into...
1538	1542	Extra. Extra. Seven slaughtered in North Side garage.
1542	1544	Fear of bloody aftermath. Extra. Extra.
1544	1549	- You talked me into it. Let's go. - Attagirl, Geraldine.
1550	1552	- Rosella. - Fiddle.
1552	1554	- Move along, Dolores. - Trombone.
1554	1556	- Hey, Olga, how's your back? - Trumpet.
1559	1562	- Here we are. - Are you two from the Poliakoff Agency?
1562	1565	- Yes. We're the new girls. - Brand new.
1565	1569	This is our manager, Mr Bienstock. And I'm Sweet Sue.
1570	1572	My name is Josephine.
1572	1574	I'm Daphne.
1575	1578	Saxophone, bass. Am l glad to see you girls. You saved our lives.
1579	1580	Likewise, I'm sure.
1581	1583	Where did you girls play before?
1583	1586	Here, there and... around, and...
1586	1590	We spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
1591	1593	All aboard.
1593	1595	You're in berths 7 and 7A.
1595	1596	7 and 7A.
1596	1598	- Thanks ever so. - You're welcome.
1598	1600	Oh. The feeling's mutual.
1602	1605	- Upsy-daisy. - Fresh.
1605	1608	Looks like Poliakoff sent a couple of real ladies.
1608	1611	You'd better tell the other girls to watch their language.
1621	1622	What are you...?
1622	1624	Daphne?
1624	1627	l never did like the name Geraldine.
1634	1637	Hi. I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.
1639	1641	My name is Josephine. Sax.
1642	1646	- Welcome to No Man's Land. - You'll be sorry.
1646	1650	- Take off your corsets and spread out. - Oh, l don't wear one myself.
1650	1652	- Don't you bulge? - Bulge? Me?
1652	1655	l have the most divine seamstress. Comes in just once a month.
1656	1659	- She is so inexpensive and she told... - Come on, Daphne.
1659	1663	Say, do you know the one about the girl tuba player
1663	1666	who was stranded on an island with a one-legged jockey?
1666	1670	- No. How does it go? - Cut it out, girls. No rough talk.
1670	1674	They went to a conservatory.
1677	1680	How about that talent, huh?
1680	1683	- Like fallin' into a tub of butter. - Watch it, Daphne.
1683	1687	When l was a kid, Joe, l dreamed l was locked up overnight in a pastry shop.
1688	1690	And there was goodies all around.
1690	1695	Jelly rolls, mocha éclairs and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts...
1695	1698	Listen to me: no butter, no pastry. We're on a diet.
1698	1700	Yeah, sure, Joe.
1700	1703	Not there. That's the emergency brake.
1705	1707	Now you've done it.
1707	1711	- Done what? - You tore off one of my chests.
1711	1715	- You'd better go get it fixed. - You'd better come help me.
1723	1725	This way, Daphne.
1725	1728	Now you tore the other one.
1740	1742	Terribly sorry.
1742	1744	It's OK. l was scared it was Sweet Sue.
1744	1747	- You won't tell anybody, will you? - Tell what?
1747	1750	lf they catch me once more, they'll kick me out of the band.
1752	1754	Are you the replacement for the bass and sax?
1754	1756	That's us. And I'm Daphne.
1756	1758	This is Joe... sephine.
1759	1760	Come in.
1761	1762	I'm Sugar Cane.
1762	1765	- Sugar Cane? - l changed it from Sugar Kowalczyk.
1766	1769	- Polish? - Yes. l come from this musical family.
1770	1772	My mother's a piano teacher. My father was a conductor.
1773	1776	- Where did he conduct? - On the Baltimore and Ohio.
1779	1782	l play the ukulele, and l sing, too.
1782	1786	l don't have much of a voice, but this isn't much of a band, either.
1786	1788	I'm only with them cos I'm running away.
1788	1792	- Running away from what? - Oh, don't get me started on that.
1792	1795	Hey, you want some? It's bourbon.
1795	1798	I'll take a rain check.
1799	1803	l don't want you to think I'm a drinker. l can stop if l want to, only l don't want to.
1803	1806	- Especially when I'm blue. - We understand.
1806	1810	All the girls drink. But I'm the one that gets caught. Story of my life.
1810	1813	l always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
1818	1820	Are my seams straight?
1820	1822	I'll say.
1824	1827	- See you around, girls. - Bye, Sugar.
1827	1829	We have been playing with the wrong bands.
1830	1832	- Down, Daphne. - See the shape of that liquor cabinet?
1832	1835	Forget it. One false move and we're off the train.
1835	1839	Then it's the police, the papers and the Mob in Chicago.
1839	1842	Boy, would l love to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
1842	1844	Look...
1844	1848	No pastry, no butter - and no Sugar.
1848	1850	You tore 'em again.
1889	1893	Hey, Sheboygan. What was your last job? Playing square dances?
1893	1895	No. Funerals.
1895	1899	Would you mind rejoining the living? Goose it up a little.
1899	1901	We'll try.
1901	1904	How did those holes get there?
1904	1907	Those?
1907	1909	l don't know.
1909	1911	Mice?
1911	1915	All right, girls. Let's take it from the top. And put a little heat under it.
1980	1982	Bienstock!
1983	1985	Yes, Sue?
1985	1989	l thought l made it clear that l don't want any drinking in this outfit.
1995	1997	All right, girls. Who does this belong to?
1997	1999	Come on, now. Speak up.
2000	2002	- Sugar, l warned you... - Please, Mr Bienstock.
2002	2005	I've had it. ln Kansas you smuggled liquor in a shampoo bottle.
2006	2008	Before that you had a pint in your ukelele...
2008	2010	Mr Bienstock, could l have my flask?
2010	2013	Sure. Pack your things. At the next station... Your flask?
2013	2017	Yes. Just a little bourbon. Must have slipped through.
2017	2018	Give me that.
2018	2021	Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
2021	2025	- Oh, yes. For a whole year. - l thought you said three years.
2026	2028	We got time off for good behaviour.
2029	2034	There are two things l will not put up with during working hours: liquor and men.
2035	2038	- Men? - Don't worry about that.
2038	2040	We wouldn't be caught dead with men.
2040	2043	Rough, hairy beasts with eight hands.
2044	2047	And they all just want one thing from a girl.
2047	2050	l beg your pardon, miss.
2050	2053	All right, girls. From the top again.
2091	2094	- Hortense, dear, good night. - Good night, Daphne.
2094	2097	- Maude, sweet dreams. - Good night, Daphne.
2097	2099	Good night, Gloria.
2099	2101	Dolores, you sleep tight, you hear?
2103	2106	- Nighty-night, Emily. - Toodle-oo.
2108	2111	How about that ''toodle-oo''.
2111	2115	Steady, boy. Just keep tellin' yourself you're a girl.
2115	2118	- I'm a girl. - You're a girl.
2118	2121	I'm a girl. I'm a girl.
2122	2123	I'm a...
2127	2130	Get a load of that rhyzhm section.
2130	2132	I'm a girl.
2132	2134	I'm a girl. I'm a girl.
2134	2136	I'm a girl.
2138	2140	Good night, Sugar.
2144	2146	Good night, honey.
2147	2150	Honey? Hey, she called me ''honey''.
2150	2152	Ooh, honey.
2152	2155	- What are you doin'? - Just makin' sure honey stays in her hive.
2155	2158	There'll be no buzzin' around tonight.
2158	2161	Supposin' l gotta go... like for a drink of water or something.
2161	2164	- Fight it. - Well, suppose l lose.
2164	2168	- Suppose it's an emergency. - Pull the emergency brake.
2169	2173	Hey, Bienstock. You know, there's something funny about those new girls.
2173	2177	- Funny? ln what way? - l don't know, but l can feel it right here.
2177	2181	Having an ulcer is like having a burglar alarm go off inside you.
2181	2184	You watch your ulcers, I'll watch those two.
2184	2188	OK, everybody go to bed. Good night, girls.
2188	2191	- Good night, Daphne. - Good night, Josephine.
2200	2202	I'm a girl. I'm a girl.
2203	2204	l wish l were dead.
2205	2209	I'm a girl... I'm a girl... I'm a girl...
2251	2252	Daphne.
2263	2264	Sugar.
2264	2268	l wanted to thank you for covering up for me. You're a real pal.
2271	2273	It's nothing.
2273	2275	l just thought that us girls should stick together.
2275	2278	lf it wasn't for you, they'd have kicked me off the train.
2278	2281	I'd be out in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
2283	2285	It's freezing outside.
2285	2288	l mean, when l think about you and your poor ukulele...
2288	2290	lf there's ever anyzhing l can do for you...
2291	2293	l can think of a million things.
2296	2298	That's one of 'em.
2298	2301	It's Sweet Sue.
2313	2315	l don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
2315	2319	Oh, well, we won't tell anybody. Not even Josephine.
2319	2322	Maybe I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
2322	2325	You stay here as long as you like.
2327	2329	I'm not crowding you, am l?
2329	2332	No. It's nice and cosy.
2333	2337	When l was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I'd crawl into bed with my sister.
2338	2341	We'd cuddle up under the covers and pretend we were lost in a dark cave
2341	2344	and were trying to find our way out.
2344	2346	Very interesting.
2348	2351	- Anyzhing wrong? - No, no. Not a thing.
2353	2355	You poor thing. You're trembling all over.
2355	2357	That's ridiculous.
2358	2360	- Your head's hot. - That's ridiculous.
2361	2364	- You've got cold feet. - Isn't that ridiculous?
2364	2366	Here, let me warm them up a little.
2366	2370	- There. Isn't that better? - Yes. I'm a girl... I'm a girl...
2370	2372	- What? - I'm a very sick girl.
2373	2375	- I'd better go before l catch something. - Not that sick.
2375	2377	I've got very low resistance.
2378	2381	Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, my dear,
2382	2385	the best thing in the world is a shot of whiskey.
2385	2388	- You've got some? - l know where to get it.
2388	2389	Don't move.
2390	2392	- Hold on. - OK.
2414	2416	Up. Up.
2422	2424	- Are you all right? - I'm fine.
2424	2427	- How's the bottle? - Half-full.
2428	2430	- You'd better get some cups. - Cups?
2441	2445	Oh, l tell you, my dear, this is the only way to travel.
2445	2447	Put on the lights. l can't see what I'm doing.
2448	2450	No lights. We don't want them to know.
2450	2453	- But l might spill some. - So spill it.
2453	2456	Spills, thrills, laughs and games.
2456	2459	This may even turn out to be a surprise party.
2459	2461	- What's the surprise? - Not yet.
2461	2464	- When? - Better have a drink first.
2464	2466	That'll put hair on your chest.
2466	2468	No fair guessing.
2470	2472	Is this a private clambake?
2472	2474	It's private. Please, go away.
2474	2476	Dolores, do you still have that vermouth?
2476	2478	- Sure. - Who needs vermouth?
2478	2481	We've got bourbon. We can make Manhattans.
2481	2483	Manhattans? At this time of night?
2483	2486	- Bring the cocktail shaker. - Oh, Sugar.
2486	2488	You're gonna spoil my surprise.
2490	2492	- Hey, honey, what's up? - Party in upper 7.
2492	2497	- I'll get cheese and crackers. - I'll get a shaker, you get a corkscrew.
2497	2499	Hey, Rosella, there's a party in upper 7.
2499	2501	- You got a corkscrew? - Stella has.
2501	2504	Go get some paper cups.
2504	2506	Hey, there's a party in upper 7.
2511	2515	- Here's the vermouth. - This is a private party. Please go away.
2515	2517	l brought some cheese and crackers.
2518	2521	- Will ten cups be enough? - This is a party for two. Ten cups?
2523	2527	- Please, girls. Will you stop this? - Could you use some Southern Comfort?
2528	2531	Girls, you'll wake up the neighbours downstairs.
2532	2534	Watch that corkscrew.
2534	2537	- Here's a cracker. - No crackers in bed.
2537	2540	Will you girls go away and form your own party?
2540	2542	Here's the cocktail shaker.
2542	2545	- I wish we had ice. - Easy on the vermouth.
2546	2550	1 3 girls in a berth is bad luck. 1 2 of you will have to get out.
2550	2553	- Pass me the peanut butter. - Anyone for salami?
2553	2556	No more food. I'll have ants in the morning.
2557	2561	Hey. Have you got any maraschino cherries on you?
2561	2563	Never mind.
2569	2571	Maraschino cherries?
2581	2582	What's going on here?
2582	2586	Daphne. Daphne, where are you?
2587	2590	It's not my fault. l didn't invite 'em.
2590	2592	Come on, girls, break it up.
2592	2596	You heard Josephine. Girls. Everybody out.
2597	2600	- Not you, Sugar. - I'm going to get some ice.
2600	2602	Get out.
2602	2605	That's right, Sugar. Now the rest of you. Out.
2606	2609	- Come on in. The water's fine. - Have a Manhattan.
2609	2613	- Pipe down. We'll all be fired. - Sugar. Don't leave me here alone.
2613	2615	Come on, kids. It's two o'clock.
2616	2619	You've had your fun. The party's over. Everybody go home.
2620	2623	- What's this? - Josephine, over here before it melts.
2630	2632	Put it here.
2632	2635	Sugar, you're gonna get into a lot of trouble.
2635	2636	You'd better keep a lookout.
2637	2639	lf Bienstock catches you again...
2639	2641	What's the matter with you, anyway?
2641	2643	I'm not very bright, l guess.
2643	2645	l wouldn't say that. Careless, maybe.
2646	2650	No, just dumb. lf l had any brains, l wouldn't be with this crummy girls' band.
2651	2652	Well, why'd you take this job?
2652	2655	l used to sing with male bands, but l can't afford it any more.
2655	2658	Have you ever been with a male band?
2658	2659	Who, me?
2660	2661	That's what I'm running away from.
2661	2665	l worked with six in the last two years. Oh, brother.
2665	2667	- Rough? - I'll say.
2667	2670	- You can't trust those guys. - l can't trust myself.
2670	2673	l have this thing about saxophone players.
2673	2675	Especially tenor sax.
2677	2680	- Really? - l don't know why, but they curdle me.
2681	2684	All they have to do is play eight bars of ''Come To Me, My Melancholy Baby''
2684	2688	and l get goose-pimply all over, and l come to 'em.
2688	2690	- That so? - Every time.
2692	2694	You know, l play tenor sax.
2694	2698	But you're a girl - thank goodness. That's why l joined this band.
2698	2703	Safety first. Anyzhing to get away from those bums.
2703	2706	You don't know what they're like. You fall for 'em.
2706	2709	You think this is gonna be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin.
2709	2712	The next thing you know, they're borrowing money from you,
2712	2715	spending it on other dames and betting on horses.
2715	2717	You don't say.
2717	2720	Then one morning you wake up, the guy's gone, the sax's gone.
2720	2725	All that's left is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste all squeezed out.
2725	2730	You pull yourself together, you go on to the next job, the next saxophone player.
2730	2732	It's the same thing all over again.
2732	2736	You see what l mean? Not very bright.
2736	2738	Brains aren't everyzhing.
2739	2742	l can tell you one thing. It's not gonna happen to me again - ever.
2742	2745	I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
2745	2750	lce. What's keeping the ice? The natives are getting restless.
2750	2753	- How about a couple of drinks for us? - Sure.
2754	2757	- You know, I'm gonna be 25 in June. - You are?
2757	2760	That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
2760	2762	- About what? - The future.
2762	2765	You know - like a husband. That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
2765	2769	- What's in Florida? - Millionaires. Flocks of them.
2769	2771	They all go south for the winter, like birds.
2771	2775	- Gonna catch yourself a rich bird? - l don't care how rich he is.
2775	2779	As long as he has a yacht, a private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
2779	2782	- You're entitled. - Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
2782	2786	With money like Rockefeller and shoulders like Johnny Weissmuller.
2786	2789	- l want mine to wear glasses. - Glasses?
2789	2793	Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless.
2793	2796	- Haven't you ever noticed it? - Yeah, now that you mention.
2797	2799	They get those weak eyes from reading.
2799	2804	Those long, tiny little columns in The Wall Street Journal.
2805	2808	That bass fiddle, she sure knows how to throw a party.
2808	2811	Hot-diggety-dog.
2811	2813	Well, happy days.
2813	2819	l hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.
2821	2823	So the one-legged jockey said...
2823	2825	What did he say?
2825	2831	So the one-legged jockey said: ''Don't worry about me, baby. l ride side-saddle.''
2838	2840	I'm terribly sorry. l seem to have hiccups.
2840	2843	Hey, let's rub some ice on her neck.
2843	2845	l think... Ow. You dropped it.
2845	2847	Oh, that's cold.
2847	2851	- Oh, no, please. Don't do that. - She's ticklish.
2854	2857	Help. Please. Help. Help.
2857	2858	Josephine.
2858	2862	Please stop that. Stop that.
2873	2875	- What happened? - Search me.
2875	2877	l mean, I'll see.
2887	2890	All right, what's goin' on around here?
2890	2892	Bienstock!
2893	2895	Are we in Florida?
2940	2941	Sugar?
2942	2944	Here. I'll carry the instruments.
2944	2947	- Thank you, Daphne. - Thank you, Daphne.
2947	2949	Isn't she a sweetheart?
2955	2957	How do you do?
2960	2962	Zowie!
2962	2965	There they are. More millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
2965	2967	l bet there isn't one under 75.
2967	2971	That's three quarters of a century. Makes a girl think.
2971	2974	Let's hope they brought their grandsons along.
2974	2975	Yes.
2984	2986	Pardon me, miss.
2988	2990	- May l? - Help yourself.
2990	2993	I'm Osgood Fielding the Third.
2993	2995	I'm Cinderella the Second.
2995	3000	lf there's one thing l admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.
3001	3003	Me, too. Bye-bye.
3003	3006	- Let me carry one of the instruments. - Oh, thank you.
3006	3009	Aren't you a sweetheart.
3014	3017	lt certainly is delightful having young blood around here.
3017	3018	Personally, I'm type O.
3019	3021	I've always been fascinated by show business.
3021	3023	ls that so?
3023	3026	As a matter of fact, it's cost my family quite a bit of money.
3026	3029	- Oh, you invest in shows? - Showgirls.
3029	3032	- I've been married seven or eight times. - You're not sure?
3032	3034	Mama is keeping score.
3035	3037	- She's getting annoyed with me. - l wouldn't wonder.
3037	3041	So when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.
3041	3046	She thinks I'm out on my yacht, deep-sea fishing.
3047	3051	Well, pull in your reel, Mr Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
3053	3056	lf l promise not to be a naughty boy, how about dinner?
3056	3059	- I'm sorry. I'll be on the bandstand. - Oh, of course.
3059	3062	- Which instrument do you play? - Bull fiddle.
3062	3063	Oh, fascinating.
3063	3066	Do you use a bow, or do you just pluck it?
3067	3070	Most of the time, l slap it.
3070	3072	You must be quite a girl.
3073	3074	Wanna bet?
3075	3078	My last wife was an acrobatic dancer. Sort of a contortionist.
3078	3082	She could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes.
3082	3083	Zowie!
3084	3086	- But Mama broke it up. - Why?
3086	3088	She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
3090	3092	- Bye-bye, Mr Fielding. - Bye-bye?
3092	3095	- This is where l get off. - Oh, no. No, no, no.
3096	3098	You don't get off that easy.
3098	3100	All right, driver. Once around the park, slowly.
3101	3103	And keep your eyes on the road.
3112	3115	What kind of a girl do you think l am, Mr Fielding?
3117	3120	- Oh, please. lt won't happen again. - I'll say.
3120	3123	- Please, come back. - I'll walk, thank you.
3123	3125	Please, miss...
3127	3129	Zowie!
3129	3132	All right, girls. Here are your room assignments.
3132	3135	My glasses. Where are my glasses?
3136	3138	Olga and Mary Lou are in 41 2.
3138	3142	And, Mary Lou, do up your kimono when you ring for room service.
3142	3144	Josephine and Daphne are in 41 3.
3144	3147	- Dolores and Sugar in 414. - Me and Sugar?
3147	3150	What did you expect? A one-legged jockey?
3150	3151	Rosella and Emily in 41 5...
3152	3155	- l wish they'd put us in the same room. - So do l.
3155	3158	But don't worry about it, Sugar. We'll see a lot of each other.
3160	3164	414... That's the same room number l had in Cincinnati,
3164	3166	my last time around with a male band.
3166	3168	What a heel he was.
3168	3172	- A saxophone player? - What else? Was l ever crazy about him.
3172	3175	At two in the morning he sent me down for hot dogs and potato salad.
3175	3178	They were out of potato salad, so l brought coleslaw.
3178	3182	- So he threw it right in my face. - Forget saxophone players.
3182	3185	You're gonna meet a millionaire - a young one.
3185	3188	- What makes you so sure? - My feminine intuition.
3197	3199	Oh. Are these your bags?
3200	3203	- And that one, too. - OK, doll.
3204	3208	- l suppose you want a tip. - Forget it, doll.
3208	3213	After all, you work here and l work here. It's nice to have you with the organisation.
3213	3215	- Bye-bye. - Listen, doll.
3215	3218	- What time do you get off tonight? - Why?
3218	3221	I'm workin' the night shift and l got a bottle of gin stashed away.
3222	3225	- When there's a lull... - Aren't you a little young for that, sonny?
3225	3229	Oh, you wanna see my driver's licence?
3230	3235	- Get lost, will you? - That's the way l like 'em - big and sassy.
3236	3238	Oh, and... get rid of your roommate.
3253	3255	- Dirty old man. - What happened?
3255	3258	- l got pinched in the elevator. - See how the other half lives?
3259	3260	I'm not even pretty.
3260	3264	They don't care. You're wearing a skirt. It's like waving a red flag to a bull.
3264	3267	I'm sick of being the flag. l wanna be a bull again.
3267	3269	- Let's blow. - Blow where?
3270	3273	You promised me that the minute we hit Florida we'd beat it.
3273	3277	- How can we? We're broke. - We can find another band. A male band.
3277	3282	Spats Colombo is looking for us in every male band in the country.
3282	3286	- It's humiliating. - So you got pinched. So what?
3286	3288	Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
3289	3291	But how long can we keep this up?
3291	3293	What's the beef? We're sittin' pretty.
3293	3297	Look. We get room and board. We're getting paid every week. Look.
3297	3299	Look at the palm trees, flying fish...
3299	3302	What are you givin' me with flyin' fish?
3302	3304	l know why you wanna stay. You're after Sugar.
3304	3307	- Me, after Sugar? - l saw the both of you in that bus.
3307	3311	All lovey-dovey and whisperin' and borrowin' each other's lipstick.
3311	3314	- What are you saying? Me and Sugar? - You and Sugar.
3314	3318	- We're just like sisters. - Well, I'm your fairy godmother.
3318	3321	And I'm gonna keep an eye on you.
3322	3324	Are you decent?
3329	3331	Come in.
3331	3334	You girls seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
3335	3336	lt has all my resort clothes.
3336	3339	- No, we haven't. - l can't understand it.
3339	3342	First my glasses disappear, then one of my suitcases.
3342	3344	- Where's my ukulele? - Now a ukulele.
3344	3348	- There must be a sneak thief around here. - Oh. Here it is. Hi, Sug.
3349	3352	- We're going for a swim. Coming? - A swim. Oh, you betcha.
3353	3355	You haven't got a bathing suit.
3355	3357	l don't have one either.
3357	3361	- She doesn't have one either. You don't? - We can rent some at the bathhouse.
3361	3365	- How about you, Josephine? - l think I'll soak in a hot tub.
3365	3369	- On a day like this? It's lovely out. - Yeah, well, let her soak. Come on.
3369	3373	- Don't get burned, Daphne. - Oh, I've got suntan lotion.
3373	3378	See? She'll rub it on me, I'll rub it on her, we'll rub it on each other. Bye-bye.
3440	3444	Daphne. Cut it out. What do you think you're doing?
3444	3447	Just a little trick l picked up in the elevator.
3447	3451	Ooh, look out. Here comes a big one.
3481	3484	Daphne. l had no idea you were such a big girl.
3484	3487	You should've seen me before l went on a diet.
3487	3489	l mean your shoulders and your arms.
3489	3491	It's carrying that bull fiddle around.
3491	3494	- There's one thing l envy you for. - What's that?
3494	3496	You're so flat-chested.
3496	3499	Clothes hang better on you than they do on me.
3499	3501	Watch out, Daphne.
3501	3504	Sugar, come on. Let's play ball.
3505	3507	Junior, time for your nap.
3507	3509	No. l wanna play.
3510	3512	You heard your mother, Junior. Scram!
3512	3515	This beach ain't big enough for the both of us.
3515	3517	Mommy!
3517	3519	Here we go.
3519	3522	l like coffee, l like tea.
3522	3526	How many boys are stuck on me?
3526	3529	One, two, three,
3529	3532	four, five, six, seven...
3539	3541	I'm terribly sorry. You're not hurt, are you?
3541	3544	- l don't think so. - l wish you'd make sure.
3544	3546	Because when people find out who l am,
3546	3551	they hire a shyster lawyer and sue me for three quarters of a million dollars.
3551	3555	- l won't sue you, no matter who you are. - Thank you.
3557	3559	- Who are you? - Now, really!
3561	3563	Sugar!
3563	3565	Come on.
3565	3567	Honestly.
3568	3570	Cheerio.
3575	3578	- Haven't l seen you somewhere before? - Not very likely.
3578	3580	- Are you staying at the hotel? - Not at all.
3580	3582	Your face is familiar.
3583	3585	You may have seen it in newspapers or magazines.
3585	3588	- Vanity Fair. - That must be it.
3588	3592	Would you mind moving a little? You're blocking my view.
3592	3593	Of what?
3593	3597	They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
3598	3600	You own a yacht?
3600	3602	Which one is it? The big one?
3603	3604	Certainly not.
3604	3609	With all the world unrest, nobody should have a yacht that sleeps more than 1 2.
3609	3611	l quite agree.
3611	3614	Tell me, who runs up that flag?
3614	3616	- Your wife? - No, my flag steward.
3617	3620	Who mixes the cocktails? Your wife?
3620	3622	No, my cocktail steward.
3622	3624	Look, if you're interested in whether l am married or not...
3625	3627	- Oh, I'm not interested at all. - Well, I'm not.
3628	3631	That's very interesting.
3633	3636	- How's the stock market? - Up, up, up.
3636	3639	I'll bet while we were talking, you made $100,000?
3639	3641	Could be. You play the market?
3641	3645	- No, the ukulele. And l sing, too. - For your own amusement?
3645	3647	We are appearing at the hotel.
3647	3649	Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators.
3649	3653	- You're society girls. - Oh, yes, quite. Bryn Mawr, Vassar...
3654	3656	We're just doing this for a lark.
3656	3660	Syncopators. Does that mean you play that very fast music... jazz?
3661	3663	Yeah. Real hot.
3663	3667	l guess some like it hot. l personally prefer classical music.
3668	3669	l do, too.
3669	3674	As a matter of fact, l spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
3674	3678	Good school. Your family doesn't object to your career?
3678	3682	They do indeed. Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent.
3682	3683	But l don't care. lt was such a bore.
3684	3686	- Coming-out parties. - lnauguration balls.
3686	3688	- Opening at the opera. - Riding to hounds.
3688	3691	And always the same 400.
3691	3694	It's amazing we never ran into each other before.
3694	3697	I'd have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
3697	3701	You're very kind. I'll bet you're also gentle and helpless.
3701	3702	l beg your pardon?
3703	3705	You see, l have a theory about men who wear glasses.
3705	3709	- What theory? - I'll tell you when l know you better.
3709	3711	- What are you doing tonight? - Tonight?
3712	3715	Maybe you could come to the hotel and hear us play.
3715	3718	- I'd like to, but that would be difficult. - Why?
3718	3721	l only come ashore twice a day when the tide goes out.
3721	3724	It's on account of these shells. That's my hobby.
3724	3727	- You collect shells? - So did my father and grandfather.
3727	3730	You might say we had a passion for shells.
3730	3733	That's why we named the oil company after it.
3734	3739	- Shell Oil? - Please, no names. Just call me Junior.
3739	3741	Sugar!
3741	3743	Time to change for dinner.
3743	3746	Run along, Daphne dear. I'll catch up with you later.
3757	3759	What, young lady? What are you staring at?
3759	3761	Happens to me all the time.
3761	3765	l recognised him, too. His picture was in Vanity Fair.
3765	3768	- Would you move along, please? - Yes. You're in his way.
3768	3771	He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
3771	3773	His yacht?
3773	3776	lt sleeps 1 2. This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
3777	3778	I'm a what?
3778	3780	Or was it Bryn Mawr?
3782	3785	l heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.
3786	3787	She squealed on her roommate
3788	3791	and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
3791	3796	Yes. We have to be very careful whom we pick for a roommate. Hm?
3796	3798	Well, l think I'd better be going.
3798	3800	lt was delightful meeting you both.
3800	3803	- You will come and hear us play? - lf it's at all possible.
3804	3806	Do come. lt'll be such fun.
3806	3809	- And bring your yacht. - Come on, Daphne.
3815	3819	- How about that guy?! - Hands off. l saw him first.
3820	3824	Sugar, a little advice. lf l were a girl, and l am, I'd watch my step.
3825	3827	lf I'd been watching my step, l never would have met him.
3827	3831	- l can't wait to tell Josephine. - Yeah, Josephine...
3831	3834	l can't wait to see her face. Will she be surprised.
3834	3837	Neither can l. Let's go tell her right now.
3837	3839	- We don't have to run. - Oh yes, we do.
3848	3850	Josephine. Yoo-hoo.
3851	3854	- l guess she's not here. - Isn't that funny. Josie!
3854	3856	l can't imagine where she'd be.
3856	3858	- I'll be back later. - Oh, no. You wait.
3858	3860	l have a feeling she'll show up any minute.
3860	3865	- Believe it or not, Josephine predicted it. - Yes. This is one for Ripley.
3865	3868	- Do you suppose she went shopping? - Shopping. That's it.
3868	3873	Something tells me she's gonna come through that door in a brand-new outfit.
3886	3889	- Josephine. - Oh. l didn't hear you come in.
3896	3901	- Have a good time, girls? - The most wonderful thing happened.
3901	3903	- What? - Guess.
3903	3907	- They repealed Prohibition? - Oh, you can do better than that.
3908	3910	- l met one of them. - One of whom?
3910	3914	Shell Oil Junior. He's got millions, glasses and a yacht.
3914	3916	You don't say.
3916	3918	He's not only got a yacht. He's got a bicycle.
3918	3920	Daphne.
3920	3922	Go on. Tell me all about him.
3922	3925	Well, he's young and he's handsome. He's a bachelor.
3925	3930	He's a real gentleman. You know. Not one of these grabbers.
3930	3932	Maybe you'd better go after him if you don't want to lose him.
3933	3937	I'm not gonna let this one get away. He's so cute. He collects shells.
3937	3939	Shells? Whatever for?
3939	3943	Oh, you know. The old shell game?
3943	3944	Daphne, you're bothering us.
3945	3947	- Anyway, you're gonna meet him tonight. - l am?
3947	3950	He said he'd come to hear us play - maybe.
3950	3954	What do you mean, maybe? l saw the way he looked at you. He'll be there for sure.
3954	3956	l hope so.
3956	3960	What do you think, Josephine? What does your crystal ball say?
3960	3963	Sugar. ls Sugar in here?
3963	3968	Sugar, you got the key? I'm locked out and I'm makin' a puddle in the hall.
3968	3970	See you on the bandstand, girls.
3974	3978	What are you tryin' to do to that girl, puttin' on a millionaire act?
3978	3982	And that phoney accent? Nobody talks like that.
3982	3984	I've seen you pull some low tricks on women.
3984	3988	This is without doubt the trickiest, lowest, meanest...
3994	3997	I'm not afraid of you.
3998	4000	I'm thin, but I'm wiry.
4000	4004	You're gonna get hurt. When I'm aroused, I'm a tiger.
4005	4009	Joe. Don't look at me like that. lt was all a joke. l didn't mean any harm.
4009	4012	I'm gonna press the suit myself. Telephone.
4013	4015	Answer the tele...phone.
4019	4021	Hello?
4022	4024	Yes, this is 41 3.
4025	4028	Ship to shore? All right, I'll take it.
4028	4031	Daphne? It's that naughty boy again.
4031	4033	You know - Osgood? ln the elevator?
4033	4036	You slapped my face?
4037	4040	- Who is this? - This is her roommate.
4040	4042	Daphne can't talk right now. ls it urgent?
4042	4045	Well, it is to me. Will you give her a message?
4045	4050	Tell her I'd like her to have supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
4050	4053	Got it. Supper, yacht, after the show. I'll tell her.
4053	4057	- Your yacht? - The New Caledonia. That's its name.
4057	4061	The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.
4062	4067	But tell her not to worry. This'll be a quiet little midnight snack, just the two of us.
4068	4072	Just the two of you? What about the crew?
4072	4076	That's all been taken care of. I'm giving them shore leave.
4076	4079	We'll have cold pheasant with champagne.
4079	4083	I've checked with the coastguard. There's gonna be a full moon tonight.
4084	4088	And tell her I've got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records.
4089	4093	That's good thinking. Daphne's a pushover for him.
4093	4095	Pushover for who? What...
4096	4098	Yes, Mr Fielding.
4098	4102	You'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat. Goodbye.
4102	4104	What's that you said?
4104	4108	- ''Zowie.'' I'll give her the message. - What message? What motorboat?
4108	4113	You got it made. Fielding wants to have cold pheasant with you on his yacht.
4113	4116	Just the three of you on that great big boat. You, him and Rudy Vallee.
4117	4119	Fat chance. Call him back and say I'm not goin'.
4119	4121	Of course you're not.
4121	4123	I'm going.
4124	4127	You're gonna be on the boat with that dirty old man?
4127	4129	I'm gonna be on the boat with Sugar.
4129	4132	- Where's he gonna be? - He's gonna be ashore with you.
4132	4134	- With me? - That's right.
4134	4137	Oh, no. Not tonight, Josephine.
4213	4216	Daphne, your boyfriend's waving at you.
4216	4218	You can both go take a flyin' jump.
4218	4221	Remember, he's your date for tonight, so smile.
4223	4227	Oh, you can do better than that. Give him the teeth, the whole personality.
4237	4240	Why do l let you talk me into these things? Why?
4240	4243	Because we're pals. The two musketeers.
4243	4247	Don't give me the musketeers. How am l gonna keep him ashore?
4247	4250	Tell him you get seasick. Play miniature golf with him.
4250	4254	Oh, no. I'm not gonna get caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
4259	4261	Hi. Which of you dolls is Daphne?
4261	4263	Bull fiddle.
4263	4265	From satchel mouth at table seven.
4270	4274	- This is from me to you, doll. - Beat it, buster.
4274	4278	Never mind leaving your door open. l got a passkey.
4284	4288	- What are you doin' with my flowers? - Borrowing 'em. You'll get 'em back.
4317	4321	l guess he's not gonna show up. It's five minutes to one.
4321	4324	- Do you suppose he forgot? - You know how those millionaires are.
4325	4326	These came for you.
4327	4328	For me?
4330	4332	It's Shell Oil.
4332	4334	- No! - Yes!
4334	4336	He wants to have supper with me on his yacht.
4336	4338	He's picking me up at the pier.
4338	4340	- No! - Yes.
4340	4342	You heard her - yes.
4342	4346	Josephine, just imagine. Me, Sugar Kowalczyk from Sandusky, Ohio,
4346	4348	on a millionaire's yacht.
4348	4351	lf my mother could only see me now.
4353	4356	l hope my mother never finds out.
4357	4360	That's it for tonight. This is Sweet Sue saying good night,
4360	4366	reminding all you daddies out there that every girl in my band is a virtuoso.
4366	4369	And l intend to keep it that way.
4375	4377	- Good luck. - Thanks.
4467	4470	But it's such a waste. A full moon, an empty yacht.
4470	4473	- I'll throw up. - Then let's go dancing.
4473	4475	There's a roadhouse down the coast...
4479	4482	Well, I'll be.... He does have a bicycle.
4482	4484	Who?
4484	4486	About the roadhouse?
4487	4489	They have a Cuban band that's the berries.
4489	4493	Let's go there, blindfold the orchestra and tango till dawn.
4493	4495	- You know something, Mr Fielding? - What?
4495	4497	You're dynamite.
4498	4500	You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.
4553	4555	Ahoy, there.
4556	4558	Ahoy.
4567	4569	- Been waiting long? - It's not how long you wait.
4569	4573	- It's who you're waiting for. - Thank you. And for the flowers.
4573	4578	l wanted them to fly orchids from our greenhouse, but Long lsland is fogged in.
4578	4580	It's the thought that counts.
4587	4589	l seem to be out of gas.
4590	4593	It's sort of funny, you being out of gas. l mean, Shell Oil and everyzhing.
4594	4596	Oops. There.
4601	4603	lt seems to be stuck in reverse.
4604	4608	l just got this motorboat. It's an an experimental model.
4608	4610	lt seems like they're on the wrong track.
4610	4613	Do you mind riding backwards? lt may take a little longer.
4613	4617	It's not how long it takes. It's who's taking you.
4643	4645	lt looked so small from the beach.
4645	4648	But when you're on it, it's like a cruiser or a destroyer.
4649	4653	It's just regulation-size. We have three. Mother keeps hers in Southampton.
4653	4657	Daddy's is in Venezuela. The company is laying a new pipeline.
4657	4661	My dad's more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.
4661	4663	Which is the port and which is the starboard?
4663	4666	That depends on whether you're coming or going.
4666	4670	l mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern.
4670	4675	And that's the bridge. So that you can get from one side of the boat to the other.
4675	4679	- Would you like a glass of champagne? - Love it. Which way?
4682	4686	- You have an upstairs and a downstairs. - Yes, the hurricane cellar.
4687	4692	And another nice thing about this yacht - lots of closet space.
4692	4696	Now, let me see. Where do you suppose the steward set it up?
4699	4701	ln here.
4703	4704	Of course. How silly of me.
4704	4708	On Thursdays they always serve me in the small salon.
4716	4720	It's exquisite. Like a floating mansion.
4720	4722	It's all right for a bachelor.
4723	4727	- What a beautiful fish. - l caught him off Cape Hatteras.
4727	4730	What is it?
4730	4733	It's a member of the herring family.
4733	4735	A herring?
4736	4740	Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
4740	4743	They shrink when they're marinated.
4743	4745	- Champagne? - l don't mind if l do.
4745	4748	Well, down the hatch, as we say at sea.
4748	4750	Bon voyage.
4754	4756	- Look at all that silverware. - Trophies.
4757	4760	You know. Skeet shooting, dog breeding, water polo.
4760	4762	Isn't water polo terribly dangerous?
4762	4765	I'll say. l had two ponies drowned under me.
4765	4767	Where's your shell collection?
4767	4770	Yes, of course. Where could they have put it?
4770	4773	You see, on Thursdays I'm sort of lost around here.
4773	4776	- What's on Thursdays? - It's the crew's night off.
4776	4779	- You mean we're alone on the boat? - Completely.
4779	4783	I've never been completely alone with a man in the middle of the night,
4783	4786	- in the middle of the ocean. - Oh, it's perfectly safe.
4786	4789	We're anchored. The ship's in shipshape shape.
4789	4792	The coastguard will call if any icebergs appear.
4792	4794	It's not the icebergs.
4794	4797	But certain men would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
4797	4801	- You're flattering me. - Of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
4802	4806	It's not that. It's just that I'm harmless.
4806	4809	- Harmless? How? - l don't know how to put it,
4809	4811	but I've got this thing about girls.
4811	4815	- What thing? - They just sort of leave me cold.
4815	4817	You mean, like, frigid?
4817	4819	Well, it's more like a mental block.
4819	4823	When I'm with a girl, it does absolutely nothing to me.
4823	4828	- Have you tried? - Have l. I'm trying all the time.
4834	4837	See? Nothing.
4837	4840	- Nothing at all? - Complete washout.
4840	4843	- That makes me feel just awful. - My dear, it's not your fault.
4843	4846	Now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.
4846	4848	Something goes wrong inside.
4848	4852	- You mean you can't fall in love? - Not any more.
4852	4854	l was in love once, but I'd rather not talk about it.
4855	4858	- Would you like a little cold pheasant? - What happened?
4858	4861	- l don't want to bore you. - You couldn't possibly.
4861	4863	Well...
4863	4865	lt was my freshman year at Princeton.
4866	4868	There was this girl. Her name was Nellie.
4868	4871	Her father was the vice president of Hupmobile.
4871	4873	She wore glasses, too.
4874	4876	That summer we were at the Grand Canyon.
4876	4879	We were on the highest ledge watching the sunset,
4879	4882	when suddenly we got this impulse to kiss.
4882	4885	l took off my glasses. She took off her glasses.
4885	4887	l took a step toward her.
4888	4891	She took a step toward me.
4891	4895	Yes. Eight hours later they brought her up by mule.
4895	4899	l gave her three transfusions. We had the same type blood - type O.
4899	4902	But it was too late.
4902	4904	Talk about sad.
4904	4906	Ever since then,
4907	4910	numb, no feelings, like my heart was shot full of Novocain.
4910	4913	You poor, poor boy.
4913	4916	Yes. All the money in the world, and what good is it?
4916	4918	Mint sauce or cranberries?
4918	4921	How can you think about food at a time like this?
4922	4924	What else is there for me?
4924	4927	- ls it that hopeless? - My family did everyzhing they could.
4928	4930	Hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids.
4930	4934	Got a special tutor to read me books that were banned in Boston.
4934	4936	lmported a troupe of Balinese dancers
4936	4939	with those bells on their ankles and long fingernails.
4940	4942	What a waste of money.
4942	4944	Have you ever tried American girls?
4944	4946	Why?
4952	4954	Was that anyzhing?
4955	4957	Thanks just the same.
4958	4960	You should see a doctor - a good doctor.
4960	4965	l have. l spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud, flat on my back.
4966	4971	Then there were the Mayo brothers, injections, hypnosis, mineral baths.
4971	4973	lf l wasn't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
4975	4977	Don't say that.
4977	4980	There must be some girl someplace that could...
4980	4984	lf l ever found a girl that could, I'd marry her just like that.
4985	4988	- Would you do me a favour? - Certainly. What is it?
4988	4992	l may not be Dr Freud or a Mayo brother or one of those French upstairs girls,
4992	4995	but could l take another crack at it?
4996	4998	All right, if you insist.
5011	5015	- Anyzhing this time? - I'm afraid not.
5016	5019	- Terribly sorry. - Would you like some more champagne?
5021	5025	Maybe if we had some music. How do you dim these lights?
5026	5030	Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out, but it's no use.
5030	5032	l think the light switch is over there.
5038	5040	That's the radio.
5040	5044	It's like taking someone to a concert when he's tone-deaf.
5080	5083	You're not giving yourself a chance.
5083	5086	Don't fight it.
5086	5088	Relax.
5101	5104	It's like smoking without inhaling.
5104	5106	So inhale.
5129	5130	Daphne,
5130	5133	- you're leading again. - Sorry.
5147	5149	Well?
5150	5152	I'm not quite sure.
5152	5155	Would you try it again?
5165	5168	l got a funny sensation in my toes.
5169	5172	Like someone was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
5174	5177	Let's throw another log on the fire.
5186	5189	l think you're on the right track.
5190	5193	l must be. Your glasses are beginning to steam up.
5218	5220	l never knew it could be like this.
5222	5224	Thank you.
5224	5227	They told me l was kaput, finished, all washed up.
5227	5231	And here you are, making a chump out of all those experts.
5234	5236	Mineral baths. Now, really.
5236	5239	Where did you learn to kiss like that?
5240	5243	l used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
5253	5258	Tomorrow, remind me to send a cheque for $100,000 to the Milk Fund.
5323	5324	Whoops.
5352	5355	- Good night. - Good morning.
5355	5358	How much do l owe the Milk Fund so far?
5358	5360	$850,000.
5360	5363	Let's make it an even million.
5384	5386	l forgot to give you a receipt.
5428	5430	Hi, Jerry. Everyzhing under control?
5430	5433	Have l got things to tell you.
5433	5436	- What happened? - I'm engaged.
5436	5440	Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl?
5440	5442	l am.
5446	5448	What?
5448	5451	Osgood proposed to me. We're planning a June wedding.
5454	5457	What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
5458	5462	- Do you think he's too old for me? - Jerry, you can't be serious.
5462	5464	Why not? He keeps marryin' girls all the time.
5466	5468	But... you're not a girl. You're a guy.
5468	5470	And why would a guy wanna marry a guy?
5470	5472	Security.
5473	5477	- Jerry, lie down. You're not well. - Stop treatin' me like a child.
5477	5480	- I'm not stupid. l know there's a problem. - I'll say there is.
5480	5485	His mother. We need her approval. But I'm not worried because l don't smoke.
5488	5491	- Jerry, there's another problem. - Like what?
5492	5495	- Like your honeymoon. - We've been discussing that.
5496	5500	He wants to go to the Riviera, but l kinda lean towards Niagara Falls.
5503	5507	Jerry, you're outta your mind. You can't get away with this.
5507	5511	l don't expect it to last. I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
5511	5514	- Like when? - Like right after the ceremony.
5514	5517	Then we get a quick annulment, he makes a nice settlement on me
5517	5520	and l keep gettin' those alimony cheques every month.
5525	5527	Jerry, listen to me.
5527	5530	There are laws, conventions. It's just not been done.
5531	5534	Joe, this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire.
5534	5538	Jerry, will you take my advice? Forget about the whole thing, will you?
5538	5542	Just keep telling yourself you're a boy.
5542	5546	- I'm a boy. - That's the boy.
5546	5549	I'm a boy, I'm a boy, I'm a...
5549	5553	l wish l were dead. I'm a boy. Boy, oh boy, am l a boy.
5553	5556	What about my engagement present?
5556	5559	- What engagement present? - Osgood gave me a bracelet.
5561	5563	Hey, these are real diamonds.
5563	5566	Of course they're real. You think my fiancé is a bum?
5566	5570	- l guess I'll have to give it back to him. - Wait a minute, Jerry. Let's not be hasty.
5570	5574	After all, we don't wanna hurt Osgood's feelings.
5577	5579	- Just a minute. - It's me. Sugar.
5587	5588	Come in.
5589	5594	l thought l heard voices. l had to talk to somebody. l don't feel like going to sleep.
5594	5597	- What you need is a slug of bourbon. - Oh, no. I'm off that stuff for good.
5598	5602	- Did you have a nice time? - Nice?
5602	5605	lt was suicidally beautiful.
5605	5606	Did he get fresh?
5606	5610	Of course not. As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.
5610	5612	- You see, he needs help. - What for?
5613	5615	Talk about elegant. You should see the yacht.
5615	5619	Candlelight, mint sauce and cranberries.
5619	5622	Gee, l wish I'd been there.
5622	5624	I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night.
5624	5626	l think he's going to propose.
5626	5629	- As soon as he gets up his nerve. - That's some nerve.
5629	5631	Daphne got a proposal tonight.
5632	5635	- Really? - From a rich millionaire.
5635	5637	That's wonderful.
5637	5639	- Poor Josephine. - Me?
5639	5641	Well, Daphne has a beau, l have a beau...
5641	5644	lf we could only find somebody for you.
5646	5648	Here l am, doll.
5674	5678	''Friends of ltalian Opera'' - that's us.
5678	5680	Register over there.
5689	5693	Spats Colombo. Delegate from Chicago. South Side Chapter.
5694	5696	Thanks.
5696	5697	Hiya, Spats.
5697	5701	- We was layin' 8-1 you wouldn't show. - Why wouldn't l?
5701	5704	We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
5704	5708	- We all gotta go sometime. - Yeah. You never know who's next.
5708	5711	OK, Spats. Report to the sergeant at arms.
5711	5715	- What for? - Orders from Little Bonaparte.
5719	5722	- All right, Spats, get your hands up. - What's the idea?
5722	5725	Little Bonaparte don't want no hardware around.
5725	5728	All right, you're clean.
5728	5730	You're not.
5740	5742	lt ain't loaded.
5750	5753	Next. What's in here?
5753	5757	My golf clubs. Putter, niblick, No.3 iron.
5758	5760	- What's this? - My mashie.
5765	5768	See you at the banquet, Spats.
5769	5772	Where did you pick up that cheap trick?
5772	5775	Come on, boys.
5775	5778	Well. Spats Colombo, if l ever saw one.
5778	5780	Hello, copper. What brings you to Florida?
5780	5782	l heard you opera-lovers were meetin'.
5782	5785	Thought I'd come in case anybody decided to sing.
5785	5787	Big joke.
5787	5789	Where were you at 3pm on St Valentine's Day?
5789	5792	- l was at Rigoletto. - What's his first name and address?
5793	5795	It's an opera, you ignoramus.
5795	5798	- ln the garage on Clark Street? - Clark Street? Never heard of it.
5798	5802	Ever hear of Deluxe Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
5802	5805	The day after the shoot you sent in spats with blood on 'em.
5805	5807	l cut myself while shaving.
5807	5810	- You shave with spats on? - l sleep with my spats on.
5810	5813	Stop kidding. You vulcanised Toothpick Charlie, and we know it.
5813	5815	You and who else?
5815	5819	Me and those two witnesses you have been lookin' for all over Chicago.
5819	5822	Boys, know anyzhing about any garage or witnesses?
5822	5825	Us? We was with you at Rigoletto's.
5825	5827	Honest.
5828	5833	Don't worry, Spats. One of these days we're gonna dig up those two guys.
5833	5835	That's what you'll have to do - dig 'em up.
5845	5849	l feel like such a tramp, taking jewellery from a man under false pretences.
5850	5853	Get it while you're young. Fix your lips if you wanna look nice for Osgood.
5853	5856	lt'll break his heart when he finds out l can't marry him.
5856	5859	lt'll break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.
5859	5862	Can't make an omelette without breakin' an egg.
5862	5864	- What's with the omelette? - Nag, nag, nag.
5864	5869	We got a yacht, a bracelet, you've got Osgood, I've got Sugar. We'll be cookin'.
5873	5875	- Joe! - What?
5877	5880	Something tells me the omelette is about to hit the fan.
5883	5885	Come on, Daphne.
5889	5891	- Going up. - Hold it.
5899	5901	Three, please.
5912	5914	l don't mean to be forward,
5914	5917	but ain't l had the pleasure of meetin' you two broads before?
5917	5920	- Oh, no. - You must mean two other broads.
5920	5923	- You ever been in Chicago? - Us?
5923	5926	We wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago.
5926	5927	Third floor.
5927	5930	- What floor are you on, sweetie? - Never you mind.
5932	5934	Room 41 3. We'll be in touch.
5934	5936	Don't call us. We'll call you.
5949	5951	l tell you, Joe, they're onto us.
5951	5954	They're gonna line us up against the wall and...
5954	5958	The cops will find two dead dames and take us to the morgue
5958	5960	and when they undress us, I'll die of shame.
5960	5963	- Shut up and keep packing. - Yeah. OK, Joe.
5963	5965	- Not that, you idiot. - They're from Osgood.
5966	5968	He wanted me to wear 'em tonight.
5971	5975	l tell you, l will never find another man who's so good to me.
5975	5979	Joe, if we get outta this hotel alive, we'll sell this bracelet, take the money,
5979	5983	grab a boat to South America and hide out in a banana republic.
5983	5987	l figured if we eat nothing but bananas, we could live there for 50 years.
5987	5989	lf we get outta the hotel alive.
5989	5992	- Did we forget anyzhing? - Yeah. The shaving stuff.
5992	5994	- And also Sugar. - Sugar?
5994	5996	- Give me room 414. - What are you doin'?
5996	5999	- Making a telephone call. - Who has time?
5999	6001	We can't walk out on her without a goodbye.
6001	6004	You usually walk out and leave 'em with a kick in the teeth.
6004	6008	That's when l was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
6008	6011	Mail her a postcard. Those gorillas may be here any minute.
6011	6014	Room 414? This is the ship-to-shore operator.
6014	6016	Ship to shore?
6016	6018	Hey, Sugar, it's for you. From the yacht.
6023	6027	Hello, my dearest darling. It's good to hear your voice.
6027	6030	l may throw up.
6031	6035	No, l didn't sleep too well, darling. To tell the truth, l never closed an eye.
6036	6039	l never slept better. l had the most wonderful dream.
6039	6042	l was still on the yacht and the anchor broke loose.
6042	6045	We drifted for days and days.
6045	6047	You were the captain and l was the crew.
6047	6052	l kept a lookout for icebergs, l sorted your shells and mixed your cocktails,
6052	6055	and l wiped the steam off your glasses.
6055	6059	And when l woke up, l wanted to swim right back to you.
6059	6061	Yes...
6061	6064	Now, about our date for tonight...
6064	6067	I'll meet you on the pier again right after the show.
6068	6071	I'm afraid not. l can't make it tonight.
6073	6075	Not tomorrow either. l have to leave.
6075	6079	Something unexpected came up. I'm sailing right away.
6079	6081	Where to?
6082	6084	South America?
6085	6087	That is unexpected.
6088	6091	You see, we have these oil interests in Venezuela.
6091	6095	l just got a cable from Dad. The board of directors have decided on a merger.
6095	6098	A merger? How long will you be gone?
6100	6102	Quite a while.
6102	6105	As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
6105	6107	You're not?
6108	6111	Well, it's all rather complicated. What we call high finance.
6111	6116	lt just so happens the president of the Venezuelan oil syndicate has a daughter...
6116	6120	Oh. That kind of merger.
6120	6122	What is she like?
6122	6124	According to our tax adviser, she's only so-so.
6125	6126	But that's the way the oil gushes.
6126	6130	A man in my position has a responsibility to the stockholders.
6130	6134	All those little people who have invested their life savings.
6134	6138	Of course. l understand. At least, l think l do.
6138	6144	l knew you would. l only wish there was something l could do for you.
6144	6148	But you have. You've given me all that inside information.
6148	6150	Tomorrow I'm gonna call my broker
6150	6153	and have him buy me 50,000 shares of Venezuelan oil.
6153	6155	Smart move.
6155	6158	By the way, did you get my flowers?
6158	6161	You know, those orchids from my greenhouse?
6161	6165	The fog finally lifted over Long lsland and they flew them down this morning.
6165	6169	That's strange. l sent 'em to your room.
6171	6173	They should have been delivered by now.
6177	6180	Hey, Dolores, will you see if there's any flowers outside?
6186	6189	Yes, they're here. White orchids.
6189	6192	l haven't had white orchids since l was a debutante.
6194	6196	What's this?
6197	6199	What's what?
6199	6202	Oh, that. Just a little going-away present.
6203	6205	Real diamonds.
6206	6210	They must be worth their weight in gold. Are you always this generous?
6211	6213	Not always.
6213	6216	l wanted you to know how grateful l am for what you did for me.
6216	6220	l didn't do anyzhing. lt just happened.
6222	6225	The navigator just came in. We're ready to cast off.
6225	6229	Well, anchors aweigh, and have a bon voyage.
6229	6231	lf you need an orchestra to play at your wedding,
6231	6233	we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
6233	6236	Goodbye, my darling.
6236	6239	l don't know about the captain but the navigator's gettin' his tail outta here.
6240	6243	- Yeah, let's shove off. - Wait a minute. My bracelet.
6245	6247	What happened to my bracelet?
6247	6251	- Your bracelet? It's ours. - All right. What happened to our bracelet?
6251	6256	- We did the right thing with it. - You're not pullin' one of your old tricks.
6256	6258	No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.
6258	6261	It's on the level this time.
6267	6269	Where's that bourbon?
6275	6280	- What's the matter, Sugar? - l don't know. All of a sudden I'm thirsty.
6281	6283	How did you get that bracelet?
6283	6285	- You like it? - l always did.
6285	6290	Junior gave it to me. He's gone to South America to marry another girl.
6290	6293	- That's what you call high finance. - That's what l call a louse.
6293	6297	lf l were you, I'd take that bracelet and throw it back in his face.
6297	6302	He's the first nice guy I've met in my life. The only one that ever gave me anyzhing.
6302	6304	You'll forget him, Sugar.
6305	6310	How can l? No matter where l go, there'll always be a Shell station on every corner.
6310	6314	I'll bring this back when it's empty.
6316	6319	Are you crazy? The place is crawlin' with mobsters.
6319	6322	And you're makin' like Diamond Jim Brady.
6323	6325	How are we gonna get outta here? How are we gonna eat?
6325	6329	- We'll walk. lf we have to, we'll starve. - There's that ''we'' again.
6329	6332	Not that way. We don't wanna run into Spats and his chums.
6341	6343	Your hands clean?
6343	6345	Over.
6345	6347	OK, button my spats.
6350	6352	You sure dress nice, boss.
6352	6355	Say, boss. I've been talking with the other delegates.
6355	6360	The word is, Little Bonaparte is real sore over what happened to Toothpick Charlie.
6360	6364	- Him and Charlie was choirboys together. - Stop or I'll bust out cryin'.
6364	6367	He even got Charlie's last toothpick from the garage. Had it gold-plated.
6368	6369	Like l was tellin' you fellas.
6370	6373	Little Bonaparte's gettin' soft. Hasn't got it here any more.
6373	6375	Used to be like a rock.
6376	6380	- It's too bad. l think it's time he retired. - Second the motion.
6380	6382	How are we gonna retire him?
6382	6384	Oh, we'll think of somethin' cute.
6385	6389	Little Bonaparte and Toothpick Charlie will be singin' in the same choir again.
6392	6396	But this time we'll make sure there are no witnesses.
6398	6402	Look. The two broads from the elevator.
6405	6407	Hey. Join us.
6408	6411	What's the matter with those dames?
6411	6413	Maybe those dames ain't dames.
6416	6418	Same faces, same instruments.
6422	6426	- Here's your Valentine's card. - The two musicians from the garage.
6426	6431	They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago, so we'll finish the job here. Come on.
6449	6454	- All right, so what do we do now? - First we gotta get out of these clothes.
6553	6554	What happened?
6554	6557	Me and Tiny had them cornered, but we lost them in the shuffle.
6558	6561	- Where were you guys? - We was with you, at Rigoletto's.
6561	6565	- Why, you stupid idiot. - Boss, we'll get 'em after the banquet.
6565	6567	They can't be too far away.
6586	6588	Thank you.
6588	6591	Thank you, fellow opera-lovers.
6592	6596	It's been ten years since l elected myself president of this organisation,
6596	6600	and, if l say so myself, you made the right choice.
6602	6606	Let's look at the record. ln the last fiscal year,
6606	6610	we made $1 1 2 million before taxes.
6610	6613	Only we ain't payin' no taxes.
6614	6619	Of course, like in every business, we had our little misunderstandings.
6621	6623	Let us now observe one minute of silence
6623	6627	in memory of seven of our members from Chicago, North Side Chapter,
6627	6632	who are unable to be with us tonight on account of bein' rubbed out.
6637	6639	You too, Spats.
6639	6641	Up.
6651	6652	Easy, now.
6652	6656	- You know when you come out? - Yeah. Second time they sing:
6656	6660	For he's a jolly good fellow which nobody can deny.
6660	6662	OK.
6666	6670	And don't mess up the cake. l promised to bring back a piece to my kids.
6678	6680	Now, fellow delegates,
6680	6684	there comes a time in the life of every business executive
6684	6687	when he starts thinkin' about retirement.
6687	6689	No!
6691	6694	I'm lookin' around for somebody to fill my shoes.
6695	6698	I've been considerin' several candidates.
6698	6701	For instance, there's a certain party from Chicago,
6701	6703	South Side Chapter.
6706	6711	Now, some people say he's gotten a little too big for his spats.
6711	6715	But l say he's a man who'll go far.
6715	6719	Some people say he's gone too far.
6719	6723	But l say, you can't keep a good man down.
6724	6726	Of course, he's still got a lot to learn.
6727	6729	The big noise he made on St Valentine's Day,
6729	6733	that wasn't very good for public relations.
6733	6739	And lettin' them two witnesses get away. That sure was careless.
6739	6742	Don't worry about those two. They're as good as dead.
6742	6744	l almost caught up with them today.
6744	6748	You mean you let 'em get away twice?
6748	6752	Some people would say that's real sloppy.
6752	6756	But l say: to err is human, to forgive divine.
6756	6758	And just to show you what l think of you, Spats,
6758	6761	the boys told me you was gonna have a birthday.
6761	6763	So we baked you a little cake.
6764	6766	My birthday?
6766	6768	Why, it ain't for another four months.
6769	6772	So we're a little early. What's a few months between friends?
6772	6775	All right, boys. Now all together.
6775	6777	For he's a jolly good fellow.
6778	6780	For he's a jolly good fellow.
6780	6784	For he's a jolly good fellow.
6784	6786	Which nobody can deny.
6787	6789	Which nobody can deny.
6789	6791	Which nobody can deny.
6792	6794	For he's a jolly good fellow.
6794	6796	For he's a jolly good fellow.
6796	6800	For he's a jolly good fellow.
6800	6803	Which nobody can deny.
6819	6821	Big joke.
6828	6830	Let's get outta here.
6833	6835	Get those two guys.
6842	6844	What happened here?
6844	6848	There was somethin' in that cake that didn't agree with 'em.
6849	6854	My compliments to the chef. Nobody leaves this room till l get the recipe.
6854	6857	You wanna make a federal case of it?
6861	6863	Yeah.
6890	6892	They slipped through our hands.
6892	6896	We're watchin' the train station, roads and airport. They can't get away.
6896	6899	- Did you hear that? - But they're not watching yachts.
6899	6903	- You're gonna call Osgood. - What'll l tell him?
6903	6905	Tell him you're gonna elope with him.
6905	6908	Elope? But there are laws, conventions.
6908	6912	There's a convention, all right. There's also the ladies' morgue.
7034	7036	Josephine.
7037	7040	Bienstock!
7041	7043	Hey. That's no dame.
7043	7046	None of that, Sugar.
7046	7048	No guy is worth it.
7051	7053	Grab her.
7057	7059	Josephine?
7064	7068	- Osgood's meeting us at the pier. - We're not on the pier yet.
7118	7120	Hi.
7120	7122	My friend Josephine, gonna be a bridesmaid.
7122	7125	- Pleased to meet you. - Come on.
7125	7127	She's so eager.
7141	7143	Wait for Sugar!
7148	7150	- Another bridesmaid? - Flower girl.
7151	7154	- Sugar, what are you doing? - l told you, I'm not very bright.
7154	7156	Let's go.
7159	7161	You don't want me, Sugar.
7161	7163	I'm a liar and a phoney. A saxophone player.
7163	7166	One of those no-goodniks you keep running away from.
7166	7167	l know. Every time.
7168	7171	Sugar, do yourself a favour. Go back to the millionaires.
7171	7172	The sweet end of the lollipop,
7172	7176	not the coleslaw in the face and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste.
7176	7180	That's right, pour it on. Talk me out of it.
7184	7187	l called Mama. She was so happy, she cried.
7187	7190	She wants you to have her wedding gown. It's white lace.
7190	7193	Osgood, l can't get married in your mother's dress.
7194	7198	She and l, we are not built the same way.
7198	7200	- We can have it altered. - Oh no, you don't.
7202	7205	Osgood, I'm gonna level with you. We can't get married at all.
7205	7207	Why not?
7207	7208	Well...
7208	7211	ln the first place, I'm not a natural blonde.
7211	7213	Doesn't matter.
7213	7215	l smoke. l smoke all the time.
7215	7217	l don't care.
7217	7221	l have a terrible past. For three years I've been living with a saxophone player.
7221	7223	l forgive you.
7225	7228	l can never have children.
7228	7231	- We can adopt some. - You don't understand, Osgood.
7233	7236	- I'm a man. - Well,
7236	7238	nobody's perfect.
